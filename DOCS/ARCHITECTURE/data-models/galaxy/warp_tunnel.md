# Warp Tunnel Data Definition

## Overview

Warp Tunnels in Sector Wars 2102 are special pathways that allow for instantaneous travel between distant sectors. Unlike standard warps that connect adjacent sectors, warp tunnels can span across multiple sectors, clusters, or even regions within the galaxy. They come in two forms: naturally occurring tunnels and artificial tunnels created by players using Warp Jumper ships.

## Position in Galaxy Hierarchy

Warp Tunnels function as connectors between different parts of the galaxy hierarchy:
- They can connect sectors within the same cluster
- They can connect sectors across different clusters
- They can connect sectors across different regions

## Natural Warp Tunnels

Natural warp tunnels are permanent fixtures in the universe that connect distant sectors. They have the following characteristics:

1. **Formation**: Occur naturally in the universe
2. **Stability**: Permanently stable, though can be temporarily disrupted by space storms
3. **Discovery**: Must be discovered by players through exploration
4. **Distribution**: More common in frontier regions, especially around special astronomical features
5. **Access**: Generally open to all players, though endpoints may have faction restrictions

## Artificial Warp Tunnels

Artificial warp tunnels are created by players using Warp Jumper ships, allowing strategic connections between sectors:

1. **Creation Requirements**:
   - Warp Jumper ship (sacrificed in the process)
   - 100,000-500,000 credits for construction
   - Appropriate reputation with local factions
   - No existing tunnel between sectors

2. **Construction Process**:
   - 7-14 real-time days to complete
   - Construction can be disrupted
   - Requires periodic monitoring

3. **Properties**:
   - Generally stable, but less reliable than natural tunnels
   - Can be controlled by creator
   - May eventually collapse (7-30 day lifespan)
   - May require maintenance

## Warp Tunnel Mechanics

1. **Travel**: Instant travel between connected sectors
2. **Turn Cost**: 1-3 turns to use depending on distance
3. **Cooldown**: Some tunnels have reuse cooldown period
4. **Discovery**: Unknown tunnels must be discovered before use
5. **Disruption**: Space storms can temporarily disable tunnels
6. **Access Control**: Some tunnels have factional or player restrictions

## Credit/Time Sink

Artificial warp tunnels represent a significant credit and resource sink:
1. **Creation Cost**: 100,000-500,000 credits
2. **Ship Cost**: Sacrifice of a Warp Jumper ship
3. **Construction Time**: 7-14 real-time days
4. **Maintenance**: Ongoing cost to maintain artificial tunnels
