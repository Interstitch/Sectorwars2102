// Planet Data Definition

// Overview:
// Planets in Sector Wars 2102 are celestial bodies that can be colonized by players.
// They generate resources, provide storage, and serve as strategic assets. 
// Planets exist within sectors, which are part of the broader galaxy structure.

// Position in Galaxy Hierarchy:
// - Planets exist within Sectors
// - Sectors are grouped into Clusters
// - Clusters form Regions
// - Regions make up the Galaxy
