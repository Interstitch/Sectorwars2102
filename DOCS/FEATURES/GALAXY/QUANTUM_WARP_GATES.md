# Quantum Warp Gates and Natural Warp Tunnels

## Overview

The Quantum Warp system in Sector Wars 2102 consists of two distinct types of faster-than-light travel: **Natural Warp Tunnels** (pre-existing quantum phenomena) and **Player-Created Warp Gates** (artificial structures). These systems allow players to navigate the galaxy, discover isolated regions, and create strategic transportation networks.

The galaxy begins with **Terran Space** (300 sectors, configurable via admin panel) connected to the **Central Nexus** (5000 sectors). The universe is **static** and only expands when players purchase additional regions through PayPal subscriptions.

## Core Concepts

### Natural Warp Tunnels

**Natural Warp Tunnels** are pre-existing quantum phenomena connecting sectors without artificial intervention.

- **Definition**: Naturally occurring quantum connections between sectors
- **Directionality**: Can be **one-way** or **two-way**, though two-way connections are more common
- **Discovery**: Must be discovered through exploration or acquired via intelligence/map data
- **Permanence**: Natural tunnels are permanent and cannot be destroyed by players
- **Indestructibility**: Unlike player-created gates, natural tunnels are stable quantum phenomena
- **Distribution**: The majority of the starting galaxy is connected through natural warp tunnels
- **Visibility**: Once discovered, tunnels appear on the player's navigation map

### Player-Created Warp Gates

**Warp Gates** are player-constructed structures that create artificial quantum connections between distant sectors.

- **Definition**: Artificial structures creating one-way quantum passages between sectors
- **Directionality**: Each gate provides **one-way travel only** (source → destination)
- **Bidirectional Travel**: Requires constructing **two separate gates** (one in each direction)
- **Components**: Each gate consists of two physical entities:
  - **Warp Gate Beacon**: Placed at the source sector, marks the origin point
  - **Warp Gate Focus**: Placed at the destination sector, receives the warp connection
  - **Warp Gate**: The final structure created after ship sacrifice
- **Vulnerability**: Gates, beacons, and foci can be destroyed by players
- **Destruction Risk**: Destroying gates creates massive quantum explosions damaging nearby ships
- **Visibility**: All players can see and use established warp gates

## Galaxy Structure

### Starting Configuration

- **Terran Space**: 300 sectors (default, configurable via admin panel during galaxy generation)
- **Central Nexus**: 5000 sectors (sparse, light policing - "The Expanse" zone)
- **Natural Connections**: Warp tunnels connect the majority of these sectors
- **Total Starting Size**: 5,300 sectors

### Universe Growth Model

The Sector Wars 2102 universe follows a **static growth model**:

- **Static Base**: The galaxy does not expand organically or dynamically
- **Growth Mechanism**: Only expands when players **purchase new regions via PayPal subscription**
- **Region Addition**: Each purchased region adds a fixed number of sectors (typically 500-1000)
- **Region Removal**: If a subscription expires or is cancelled, the region may be removed
- **Controlled Expansion**: Universe size is directly tied to active player subscriptions

### Isolated Clusters

The galaxy contains **isolated clusters** - groups of sectors with no natural warp tunnel connections to the main network:

- **Intentional Isolation**: During galaxy generation, some clusters are deliberately created without warp tunnels to the main network
- **Discovery Opportunity**: Players can discover these hidden regions using **Warp Jumper ships**
- **Internal Connections**: Isolated clusters may have natural warp tunnels connecting sectors within the cluster
- **Strategic Value**: First discoverers gain exclusive access until gates are built by others
- **Unique Resources**: Isolated clusters often contain rare resources unavailable in connected space
- **Gateway Challenge**: Finding entry points requires exploration and Warp Jumper technology

## Warp Gate Construction

### The Reverse Creation Process

Warp Gates are created using a **reverse engineering process** with the Warp Jumper ship:

#### Step 1: Place Warp Gate Beacon (Source Sector)
- Player deploys a **Warp Gate Beacon** in the source sector
- Beacon is a physical entity visible to all players
- Beacon marks the intended origin point of the warp gate
- Beacon can be destroyed by hostile players before gate completion

#### Step 2: Warp Jump to Destination
- Player uses **Warp Jumper ship** to jump away from the beacon
- Ship performs multiple jumps in the direction of the target destination
- Each jump covers 5-10 sectors in a targeted direction
- Player navigates toward the intended destination sector

#### Step 3: Deploy Warp Gate Focus (Destination Sector)
- Upon reaching the destination, player deploys the **Warp Gate Focus**
- Focus is a physical entity visible to all players
- Focus marks the intended destination endpoint
- Focus can be destroyed by hostile players before gate completion

#### Step 4: Return to Beacon
- Player uses Warp Jumper to jump back to the Warp Gate Beacon location
- Ship must return to the exact sector where the beacon was placed

#### Step 5: Create Warp Gate (Consume Ship)
- Player **sacrifices the Warp Jumper ship** to complete the gate construction
- Ship is consumed in the process and cannot be recovered
- **Warp Gate Beacon is replaced** by the completed **Warp Gate** structure
- Warp Gate Focus remains at the destination
- One-way quantum tunnel is established: Source (Gate) → Destination (Focus)

### Resource Requirements

#### Warp Gate Beacon
- **Quantum Crystals**: 1 crystal
- **Technology**: 500 units
- **Credits**: 50,000
- **Deployment Time**: Instant (upon payment)

#### Warp Gate Focus
- **Quantum Crystals**: 1 crystal
- **Technology**: 500 units
- **Credits**: 50,000
- **Deployment Time**: Instant (upon placement)

#### Warp Gate Completion
- **Warp Jumper Ship**: Must be sacrificed (consumed completely)
- **Additional Quantum Crystals**: 1-3 crystals (based on distance between beacon and focus)
- **Prismatic Ore**: 500-1,000 units (for structural reinforcement)
- **Technology**: 1,000-2,000 units (for control systems)
- **Credits**: 100,000-500,000 (for construction and quantum stabilization)
- **Construction Time**: 7-14 real-time days after ship sacrifice

### Construction Limitations

- **Distance Constraints**: Gates can connect sectors within a certain range (maximum 50 sectors)
- **Sector Compatibility**: Some sectors may have quantum disturbances preventing gate establishment
- **Resource Availability**: Requires access to rare materials (Quantum Crystals, Prismatic Ore)
- **Ship Sacrifice**: Warp Jumper is permanently consumed during gate creation
- **Vulnerability Window**: Beacons and foci can be destroyed during the construction process
- **Time Investment**: Multi-day construction period creates strategic vulnerability

### Gate Destruction and Reclamation

- **Beacon/Focus Destruction**: Can be destroyed before gate completion, cancelling the project
- **Gate Destruction**: Completed gates can be destroyed by hostile players or owners
- **Quantum Explosion**: Gate destruction creates massive explosions damaging all ships in the sector
- **Resource Recovery**: Approximately 30-40% of Quantum Crystals can be recovered from destroyed gates
- **Quantum Disturbance**: Destruction creates a 7-day cooldown preventing new gates in that sector
- **Area Denial**: Strategic tactic to prevent enemy gate networks
- **Tactical Consideration**: Explosion hazard makes gate destruction risky near friendly forces
