## 🌌 Universe Structure

### Hierarchy Overview

```
Galaxy
├── Region (Central Nexus, Terran Space, Player-owned)
    ├── Zone (Security/policing boundaries)
    │   └── Sectors (assigned by sector_number range)
    └── Cluster (Navigation/organizational groups)
        └── Sectors (same sectors, different grouping)
```

**Important**: Zones and Clusters are **orthogonal dimensions** - sectors have BOTH a zone_id AND a cluster_id.

### Galaxy
The entire game universe containing all regions, sectors, and players. The galaxy consists of:
- **Central Nexus**: 5,000-sector hub region (1 zone)
- **Terran Space**: 300-sector starting region (3 zones)
- **Player-Owned Regions**: Variable sectors (100-1,000), customizable zones

### Region
A distinct area of space with its own governance and zones. Three region types exist:

**Central Nexus** (`central_nexus`)
- **Size**: 5,000 sectors
- **Zones**: 1 zone ("The Expanse")
- **Purpose**: Universal trade hub connecting all regions
- **Characteristics**: Sparse infrastructure, light policing, moderate danger
- **Access**: All players can always return via quantum warp tunnels

**Terran Space** (`terran_space`)
- **Size**: 300 sectors
- **Zones**: 3 zones (Federation Space, Border Regions, Frontier Space)
- **Purpose**: Starting region for new players
- **Characteristics**: Standard infrastructure, progressive security (high → low)
- **Access**: Default starting location

**Player-Owned Region** (`player_owned`)
- **Size**: 100-1,000 sectors (variable)
- **Zones**: 3 zones by default (Federation, Border, Frontier) - customizable
- **Purpose**: Private governance and custom rules
- **Subscription**: $25/month for ownership, $5/month for citizenship
- **Customization**:
  - Governance type (Democracy, Autocracy, Council Republic)
  - Tax rates (5-25%)
  - PvP rules and combat restrictions
  - Trade policies and bonuses
  - Immigration controls
  - Cultural identity and themes
  - Zone configuration (add/remove/adjust zones)

### Zone
**Security and policing regions within parent Regions**. Zones define law enforcement levels, danger ratings, and sector boundaries.

**Key Properties**:
- **Belongs to Region**: Each zone has a parent region
- **Sector Boundaries**: Defined by start_sector and end_sector numbers
- **Security Characteristics**: Policing level (0-10) and danger rating (0-10)
- **Orthogonal to Clusters**: Zone boundaries can split across cluster boundaries

**Zone Types**:
- **EXPANSE**: Central Nexus's single massive zone
- **FEDERATION**: High security, low danger (heavily policed space)
- **BORDER**: Moderate security, moderate danger (transition areas)
- **FRONTIER**: Low security, high danger (lawless space)

**Examples**:
- Central Nexus: "The Expanse" (sectors 1-5000, policing=3, danger=6)
- Terran Space Federation: "Federation Space" (sectors 1-100, policing=9, danger=1)
- Terran Space Border: "Border Regions" (sectors 101-200, policing=5, danger=4)
- Terran Space Frontier: "Frontier Space" (sectors 201-300, policing=2, danger=8)

### Cluster
**Navigation and organizational groups** of interconnected sectors. Clusters typically contain 8-15 sectors linked by warp tunnels, forming local navigation networks.

**Key Properties**:
- **Belongs to Region**: Each cluster has a parent region
- **Navigation Purpose**: Helps players organize sector exploration
- **Orthogonal to Zones**: Cluster membership independent of zone assignment
- **Warp Networks**: Sectors in same cluster often have direct warp connections

### Sector
The fundamental unit of space in the game. Each sector can contain:
- **Warp Tunnels** (connections to other sectors)
- **Ports** (trading stations)
- **Planets** (colonizable worlds)
- **Ships** (player and NPC vessels)
- **Drones** (defensive or offensive units)
- **Genesis Devices** (planet-creation tools)

Sectors are identified by numeric IDs (Sector 1 = Earth/Sol Station).

### Warp Tunnel
A navigation link between two sectors. Players can travel through warp tunnels at the cost of 1 turn per jump (modified by ship speed). Tunnels form the galaxy's navigation network.

**Types**:
- **Standard Warp Tunnel**: Normal sector-to-sector connection
- **Quantum Warp Tunnel**: Connects different regions to the Central Nexus
- **Player-Created Tunnel**: Built using Quantum Crystals

### Quantum Jump
A special ability of the **Warp Jumper** ship that allows directed movement of 5-10 sectors in a targeted direction. Has a 24-hour cooldown. Different from using warp tunnels.
