# Sector Wars 2102: Game Rules

## Core Gameplay

### Overview
Sector Wars 2102 is a turn-based space trading simulation set in the year 2102. Players navigate between sectors, trade commodities, manage ships, and can eventually colonize planets. Success depends on strategic trading, resource management, and timely upgrades.

### Turn System
- The game operates on a turn-based system
- Players are allocated 1,000 turns per day
- Most actions consume turns:
  - Traveling between sectors
  - Trading commodities
  - Attacking ships, drones, sectors, ports, or planets
  - Planetary development
- Defending against attacks does NOT consume turns
- Strategic turn management is crucial for maximizing daily progress
- Unused turns do not carry over to the next day

### Game Cycle
1. **Travel** between sectors using jump gates (consumes turns)
2. **Trade** commodities at space ports (consumes turns)
3. **Upgrade** ships and equipment (no turn cost)
4. **Colonize** planets to generate passive income (consumes turns)
5. **Attack** other ships, drones, sectors, ports, or planets (consumes turns) or **defend** against attacks (no turn cost)
6. **Manage** turn usage to optimize daily activities

## Ship Systems

### Ship Acquisition
- New players receive a starting ship (Light Freighter) upon first login
- Additional ships can be purchased at major shipyards
- If a ship is destroyed, players must purchase a new one or use their escape pod
- Ship insurance is available at friendly ports to offset replacement costs

### Ship Types
- **Trading Vessels**: Light Freighter (10,000 credits), Cargo Hauler (50,000 credits), Fast Courier (30,000 credits)
- **Combat Vessels**: Defender (70,000 credits), Carrier (150,000 credits)
- **Specialized Vessels**: Colony Ship (100,000 credits), Scout Ship (25,000 credits), Warp Jumper (500,000 credits)

For detailed specifications, refer to the [Ship Types documentation](./SHIP_TYPES.md).

### Escape System
- Every ship comes equipped with an escape pod
- Escape pods are indestructible, ensuring player survival in any situation
- When a player's ship is destroyed in combat:
  - Player is automatically ejected into their escape pod
  - Player retains all credits (credits are virtual and not stored on the ship)
  - All cargo is lost with the destroyed ship
- Players can manually eject to their escape pod at any time:
  - This leaves their ship intact but abandoned
  - Abandoned ships can be claimed by other players
  - This is a strategic risk but may be necessary in some situations
- While in an escape pod, players maintain freedom of movement but at high turn cost:
  - Escape pods consume substantially more turns when traveling between sectors
  - This high turn consumption represents their inefficient propulsion systems
- Players can dock their escape pod with a teammate's ship for transportation:
  - Both players must be in the same sector
  - The teammate's ship must have available cargo space
  - While docked, the escape pod player moves with the teammate's ship without consuming their own turns
- Players must purchase a new ship after losing one

## Combat System

### Combat Drones
- Drones provide ship defense and attack capabilities
- Can be purchased at military outposts for 1,000 credits each
- Each ship has a maximum drone capacity
- Drones engage automatically in combat situations

### Combat Resolution
- Combat occurs when:
  - A player attacks another ship, drone, sector, port, or planet (consumes turns)
  - A player enters a sector with hostile NPCs (movement turn only)
  - A player's ship, drone, sector, port, or planet is targeted by enemies (no turn cost to defend)
- Combat success depends on:
  - Number of drones
  - Ship type and defensive capabilities
  - Random elements (represented as tactical decisions)
- Important distinction: Initiating combat costs turns, defending does not

## Trading Economy

### Commodity Trading
- Space ports buy and sell various commodities
- Prices fluctuate by sector, supply, and demand
- Price differences between sectors create trading opportunities

### Available Commodities
- **Fuel**: Required for ship operations
- **Organics**: Essential for population centers
- **Equipment**: Manufactured goods and technology
- **Population Units**: Available only at Earth (Sector 1)

### Market Dynamics
- Prices rise in sectors with shortages
- Prices fall in sectors with surplus
- Supply and demand shift based on player trading activity
- Each trading transaction costs 1 turn
- Finding the best trade routes maximizes profits per turn spent

## Colonization System

### Planet Acquisition
- Unclaimed planets can be colonized
- Requirements for colonization:
  - 10,000 population units
  - 10,000 credits investment
  - Transport capacity to reach the planet

### Planet Development
- Colonized planets generate income based on population
- Planets can be developed with infrastructure:
  - Fuel production facilities
  - Organics production facilities
  - Equipment production facilities

### Population Management
- Population can be purchased from Earth at 50 credits per unit
- Each population unit occupies one cargo space during transport
- Planets require minimum population to maintain operations
- Population grows naturally over time once established

## Advanced Gameplay

### Team Formation
- Players can form teams to share resources and coordinate strategies
- Team-owned planets share production benefits
- Teams can engage in collective defense of territories
- Teams are limited to 4 players maximum to maintain balance

### Sector Control
- Teams can establish dominance in sectors through:
  - Military presence (drones and ships)
  - Infrastructure control (owned planets and ports)

## Player Progression

Player advancement in Sector Wars 2102 is measured through several key metrics:

- **Credit Accumulation**: Total earned credits throughout gameplay
- **Planets Owned**: Number and quality of colonized planets
- **Citadel Levels**: Development stage of planetary defenses
- **Ports Owned**: Commercial infrastructure controlled
- **Ships Owned**: Fleet size and composition

These progression metrics determine a player's overall standing and influence within the game universe.

## Game Balance

- Ship costs and capabilities are balanced to provide meaningful progression
- Trading profits are designed to scale with risk and investment
- Colonization represents a significant investment but provides long-term returns
- Combat system ensures no single strategy dominates gameplay
