# Quantum Trading User Guide
**Sectorwars2102 - World's First Quantum-Enhanced Space Trading Game**

Welcome to revolutionary quantum trading, where the laws of quantum mechanics drive your trading strategy and personal AI assists every decision.

## 🌟 What is Quantum Trading?

Quantum Trading transforms traditional space trading by applying real quantum mechanics principles:

- **Superposition States**: Your trades exist in multiple probability states simultaneously until you "collapse" them to reality
- **Quantum Tunneling**: Access hidden market opportunities through quantum field fluctuations  
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Higher potential profits come with increased quantum uncertainty
- **Observer Effect**: Your decisions influence market outcomes through quantum mechanics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Accessing Quantum Trading

1. **Dock at any Port**: Quantum trading requires stable quantum field anchoring
2. **Navigate to Game Dashboard** 
3. **Click the "⚛️ QUANTUM TRADING" tab**
4. **Activate ARIA AI Assistant**: Your personal quantum trading companion

### Your First Quantum Trade

1. **Select Commodity**: Choose from ORE, ORGANICS, EQUIPMENT, FUEL, LUXURY, TECHNOLOGY, COLONISTS
2. **Choose Action**: BUY or SELL
3. **Set Quantity**: Start small while learning (recommended: 50-100 units)
4. **Create Quantum Trade**: Click "Create Quantum Trade" to enter superposition

## ⚛️ Quantum Trading Mechanics

### Superposition States

When you create a quantum trade, it exists in **multiple probability states**:

```
Quantum Trade #QT_2025_001
├── Optimistic State (30% probability)
│   ├── Price: 105 credits
│   ├── Profit: +500 credits
│   └── Risk: Low
├── Likely State (40% probability)  
│   ├── Price: 98 credits
│   ├── Profit: +300 credits
│   └── Risk: Medium
└── Pessimistic State (30% probability)
    ├── Price: 92 credits
    ├── Profit: +100 credits
    └── Risk: High
```
