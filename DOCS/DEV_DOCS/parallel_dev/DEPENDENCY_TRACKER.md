## Mock Data Strategy

When blocked by dependencies, implement mock data:

### Player UI Mocks
```typescript
// Mock combat API responses
const mockCombatAPI = {
  engage: async () => ({ combatId: 'mock-123', status: 'initiated' }),
  getStatus: async () => ({ status: 'completed', rounds: [...] })
};
```

### Admin UI Mocks
```typescript
// Mock economy API responses
const mockEconomyAPI = {
  getMarketData: async () => ({ marketData: [...], timestamp: new Date() }),
  getHealth: async () => ({ creditCirculation: 1000000, inflationRate: 2.5 })
};
```

## Integration Points

### Critical Integration Tests (Week 13-14)
1. Player UI ↔ Gameserver combat flow
2. Admin UI ↔ Gameserver economy monitoring
3. All instances ↔ WebSocket real-time updates
4. Message system across all interfaces
