# Gameserver Development Progress
**Instance**: 1 - Backend/API Development  
**Developer**: Claude Code Instance 1  
**Focus Document**: DOCS/DEV_DOCS/Remaining_Gameserver.md

**REMINDER: All three main components of our game is DOCKER based and running in a container.**

## Current Status
**Phase**: 2 - Implementing Critical UI Dependencies  
**Sprint**: Team Management APIs (Week 8-9)  
**Status**: üöß Active Development - Critical path for UI teams

## Today's Progress (2025-05-28)

### ‚úÖ Completed Today

#### Critical UI Dependencies
- **Fleet Battle Service** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
  - Implemented FleetService with all battle mechanics
  - Created fleet management API endpoints
  - Battle simulation engine with formations and tactics
  - Integration with existing combat system

- **Combat System Endpoints** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
  - `/api/combat/engage` - Initiate player combat
  - `/api/combat/{id}/status` - Get combat status
  - Full integration with drone system

- **Planetary Management** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (All 8 endpoints)
  - `/api/planets/owned` - List player's planets
  - `/api/planets/{id}` - Get planet details
  - `/api/planets/{id}/allocate` - Allocate colonists
  - `/api/planets/{id}/buildings` - Manage buildings
  - `/api/planets/{id}/defenses` - Configure defenses
  - `/api/planets/{id}/genesis` - Deploy genesis device
  - `/api/planets/{id}/specialize` - Set colony type
  - `/api/planets/{id}/siege` - Get siege status

### ‚úÖ Previously Completed

#### Phase 1: Security & Messaging (COMPLETE)
- Implemented comprehensive security middleware:
  - OWASP security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Enhanced rate limiting with endpoint-specific limits
  - Input validation middleware for injection prevention
  - Audit logging middleware with database persistence
- Created audit_logs table and migration
- Implemented audit service for database persistence
- Created audit API endpoints for admin access
- Implemented complete message system:
  - Created Message model with threading support
  - Created messages table migration with proper indexes
  - Implemented MessageService with all CRUD operations
  - Created player messaging API endpoints
  - Created admin message moderation endpoints
  - Added WebSocket notifications for new messages

#### Phase 2: Combat Mechanics (IN PROGRESS)
- **Faction System** ‚úÖ
  - Created Faction model with FactionType enum
  - Implemented FactionMission model for quests
  - Created FactionService with:
    - Territory control management
    - Reputation-based pricing modifiers
    - Mission availability logic
  - Created player faction API endpoints
  - Created admin faction management endpoints
  - Fixed enum serialization issues for PostgreSQL
  - Seeded default factions in database

- **Drone Combat System** ‚úÖ
  - Created Drone, DroneDeployment, and DroneCombat models
  - Designed 5 drone types with unique stats:
    - Attack: High damage, fast movement
    - Defense: High health, area protection
    - Scout: Enhanced sensors, stealth
    - Mining: Resource extraction
    - Repair: Support abilities
  - Implemented DroneService with:
    - Drone creation and management
    - Deployment and recall functionality
    - Combat simulation engine
    - Repair and upgrade mechanics
    - Team drone coordination
  - Created player drone API endpoints
  - Created admin drone management endpoints
  - Fixed migration issues by using string columns

- **Fleet Battle System** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
  - Created comprehensive fleet models
  - Implemented FleetService with battle mechanics
  - Created all fleet API endpoints
  - Battle simulation with formations and tactics

### üöß In Progress
- Team Management API implementation (30+ endpoints)
- Starting with core team CRUD operations

### üîú Next Tasks
1. Complete Team Management APIs - CRITICAL
2. Admin Economy Dashboard endpoints - CRITICAL
3. Admin Combat Overview endpoints - CRITICAL
4. Enhanced Ship Management APIs
5. WebSocket Implementation
6. Region navigation (Phase 3)
7. Advanced trading features (Phase 3)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers
- None currently - Critical path work in progress

## Dependencies I'm Providing

### To Player UI
- Faction API endpoints (Week 5)
- Drone management endpoints (Week 5)
- Fleet battle APIs (Week 6)
- Territory status endpoints (Week 6-7)

### To Admin UI
- Faction management endpoints (Week 5)
- Drone statistics APIs (Week 5)
- Combat monitoring endpoints (Week 6)
- Territory control tools (Week 7)

---

## Dependencies I Need
- UI components for drone management (Player UI)
- Admin tools for faction editing (Admin UI)
- Combat visualization requirements (Both UIs)

---

## Technical Decisions

### Faction System
- Using string enums for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Reputation affects pricing and mission availability
- Territory control based on sector ownership

### Drone Combat
- Turn-based combat simulation
- Stats influenced by drone type and level
- Team coordination through shared deployments
