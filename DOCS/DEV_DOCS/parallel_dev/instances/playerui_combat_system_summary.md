# Player UI Combat System Implementation Summary
**Instance**: 2 of 3  
**Created**: 2025-05-28 17:35 UTC  
**Components**: Combat System

## Overview
Successfully implemented 5 out of 7 combat system components, providing comprehensive combat functionality for players. All components include security measures, input validation, and rate limiting.

## Completed Components

### 1. CombatInterface.tsx ✅
**Purpose**: Main combat engagement UI  
**Features**:
- Real-time combat visualization with health/shield bars
- Target selection and engagement controls
- Combat status updates and notifications
- Integration with drone deployment
- Rate-limited actions to prevent spam

### 2. DroneManager.tsx ✅
**Purpose**: Drone deployment and management interface  
**Features**:
- Deploy/recall drone controls
- Real-time drone status tracking
- Support for both standalone and combat-integrated modes
- Input validation for drone counts
- Visual feedback for deployment status

### 3. CombatLog.tsx ✅
**Purpose**: Combat history viewer and analytics  
**Features**:
- Searchable combat history
- Filtering by outcome (victory/defeat/draw)
- Sorting by date, duration, or damage
- Combat statistics (win rate, avg damage, efficiency)
- Export functionality for combat data

### 4. TacticalPlanner.tsx ✅
**Purpose**: Pre-combat strategy planning  
**Features**:
- Save/load tactical plans
- Target priority selection (shields/weapons/engines/hull)
- Drone strategy configuration
- Retreat condition settings
- Formation role assignment for team combat
- Plan effectiveness analysis
- Simulation capability (planned)

### 5. FormationControl.tsx ✅
**Purpose**: Team combat coordination  
**Features**:
- 5 formation types: Diamond, Line, Wedge, Box, Scattered
- Visual formation grid preview
- Position assignment for team members
- Real-time cohesion tracking
- Combat status for each member
- Formation bonuses calculation
- Emergency formation commands

## Security Implementation

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized using InputValidator class
- XSS prevention with DOMPurify
- Maximum length limits on text inputs
- Validation of numeric inputs

### Rate Limiting
- 1-second cooldown on all actions
- Prevents spam and DoS attempts
- Visual feedback when rate limited

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data exposed in client
- Secure storage using localStorage
- Input sanitization before API calls

## Mock API Integration
Created comprehensive mock combat API service that simulates:
- Combat engagements with real-time updates
- Drone deployment and management
- Combat status tracking
- Realistic combat outcomes

## Integration Points

### With GameDashboard
All components are designed to be integrated as tabs or modals in the main GameDashboard:
```typescript
import { 
  CombatInterface, 
  DroneManager, 
  CombatLog,
  TacticalPlanner,
  FormationControl 
} from './components/combat';
```

### With WebSocket
Components are prepared for real-time updates via WebSocket:
- Combat status updates
- Formation member status changes
- Drone deployment notifications

### With Game Context
Components use ship data from GameContext:
- Current ship stats
- Available drones
- Team member information

## Remaining Combat Components

### CombatAnalytics.tsx (Next)
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Combat efficiency tracking
- Weapon usage statistics
- Damage analysis

### SiegeInterface.tsx
- Planetary assault controls
- Siege progress tracking
- Bombardment targeting
- Ground force deployment

## Docker Considerations
All components are designed to work within the Docker containerized environment:
- No hardcoded URLs
- Environment-aware API endpoints
- Responsive design for container constraints
- Minimal external dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Implement CombatAnalytics.tsx
2. Implement SiegeInterface.tsx
3. Begin Ship Management components (ShipDetails.tsx)
4. Integrate all components into GameDashboard
5. Replace mock APIs with real endpoints when available
