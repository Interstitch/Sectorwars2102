## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Features Implemented
1. **Input Validation**
   - All text inputs sanitized with InputValidator
   - XSS prevention using DOMPurify
   - Maximum length limits enforced
   - Numeric input validation

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - 1-second cooldown on most actions
   - 2-second cooldown on siege actions
   - Visual feedback when rate limited
   - Prevents spam and DoS attempts

3. **Data Protection**
   - No sensitive data exposed in client
   - Secure localStorage for saved plans
   - Input sanitization before any API calls

```

### Mock API Integration
Created comprehensive mock combat API that simulates:
- Combat engagement with damage calculations
- Real-time combat status updates
- Drone deployment and management
- Combat history retrieval
- Siege progression simulation

### Docker Considerations
All components are designed for containerized deployment:
- No hardcoded URLs or paths
- Environment-aware API endpoints
- Responsive design for container constraints
- Minimal external dependencies
- Efficient bundle size

## Integration Guide

### Basic Import
```typescript
import { 
  CombatInterface, 
  DroneManager, 
  CombatLog,
  TacticalPlanner,
  FormationControl,
  CombatAnalytics,
  SiegeInterface
} from './components/combat';
```

### GameDashboard Integration Example
```typescript
// Add to tab navigation
const tabs = [
  // ... existing tabs
  { id: 'combat', label: 'Combat', icon: '⚔️' },
  { id: 'tactics', label: 'Tactics', icon: '🎯' },
  { id: 'analytics', label: 'Analytics', icon: '📊' }
];

// Add to tab content
{activeTab === 'combat' && (
  <div className="combat-section">
    <CombatInterface 
      ship={currentShip}
      onCombatEnd={handleCombatEnd}
    />
    <DroneManager 
      availableDrones={ship.drones}
      isInCombat={true}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

## Performance Optimizations
- React.memo for expensive components
- useMemo for derived calculations
- useCallback for event handlers
- Efficient re-render prevention
- Lazy loading ready (React.lazy compatible)

## Mobile Responsiveness
All components include mobile-specific styles:
- Touch-optimized controls
- Responsive grid layouts
- Collapsible sections
- Adjusted font sizes
- Simplified visualizations on small screens

## Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where appropriate
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color schemes
- Screen reader friendly

## Testing Considerations
Components are structured for easy testing:
- Pure functional components
- Isolated business logic
- Mockable dependencies
- Predictable state management

## Future Enhancements
While the combat system is complete, potential enhancements include:
1. WebSocket integration for real-time multiplayer combat
2. Advanced combat animations and effects
3. Combat replay system
4. AI opponent behaviors
5. Tournament/arena modes
6. Combat achievements and badges

## Dependencies on Backend
The following API endpoints need implementation:
- POST /api/v1/combat/engage
- GET /api/v1/combat/status/:combatId
- POST /api/v1/combat/retreat
- POST /api/v1/drones/deploy
- POST /api/v1/drones/recall
- GET /api/v1/combat/history
- POST /api/v1/siege/start
- POST /api/v1/siege/bombard
- POST /api/v1/siege/invade

## Conclusion
The combat system is now 100% complete with all 7 components implemented. Each component follows security best practices, is Docker-ready, and provides a rich user experience. The system is ready for integration into the main GameDashboard and will provide players with comprehensive combat capabilities including tactical planning, team coordination, performance analytics, and planetary conquest.

Next phase: Ship Management components starting with ShipDetails.tsx.
