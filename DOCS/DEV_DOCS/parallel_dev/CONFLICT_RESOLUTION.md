# Conflict Resolution Log
**Purpose**: Document and resolve conflicts between parallel development instances  
**Process**: Document â†’ Discuss â†’ Decide â†’ Implement

**REMINDER: All three main components of our game is DOCKER based and running in a container.**

## Conflict Priority Levels
- ðŸš¨ **URGENT**: Blocking multiple instances NOW
- ðŸ”´ **High**: Will block soon, needs resolution within 24h
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium**: Important but not immediately blocking
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low**: Minor issue, can be resolved later

---

## Active Conflicts

### [Example Format - Remove when adding real conflicts]
```
### Conflict ID: CONF-001
**Date**: 2025-05-28
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ High
**Instances Affected**: Gameserver, Player UI
**Type**: API Design Conflict

**Description**:
Disagreement on combat API response format

**Instance Positions**:
- **Gameserver**: Wants nested object structure for combat rounds
- **Player UI**: Prefers flat array for easier rendering

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. Use nested structure with UI adapter layer
2. Provide both formats via query parameter
3. Flatten on backend before sending

**Resolution**: [Pending]
**Decided By**: [Pending]
**Implementation**: [Pending]

## Conflict Types Reference

### API Design Conflicts
- Endpoint naming conventions
- Request/response formats
- Error handling approaches
- Versioning strategies

### Timeline Conflicts
- Dependency delivery delays
- Feature prioritization changes
- Resource allocation issues

### Technical Conflicts
- Architecture decisions
- Library/framework choices
- Performance vs. features tradeoffs

### Integration Conflicts
- WebSocket event naming
- Shared type definitions
- Database schema changes

---

## Resolution Guidelines

### Quick Resolution Process
1. **Document**: Clearly describe the conflict and each position
2. **Impact Analysis**: List what happens with each option
3. **Propose**: Suggest 2-3 viable solutions
4. **Decide**: Use these criteria:
   - Minimizes integration complexity
   - Follows established patterns
   - Considers performance impact
   - Maintains security standards

### Escalation Path
1. Try to resolve between affected instances first (24h)
2. If no agreement, document tradeoffs clearly
3. Choose solution that unblocks the most work
4. Document decision rationale for future reference

## Common Conflict Patterns

### "Backend vs Frontend Preferences"
**Resolution Approach**: Backend provides capability, frontend adapts if needed

### "Performance vs Features"
**Resolution Approach**: Implement basic feature first, optimize in Phase 4

### "Breaking Changes"
**Resolution Approach**: Version the API, support both temporarily

### "Dependency Delays"
**Resolution Approach**: Implement mocks, plan integration tests

---

## Emergency Protocol

For ðŸš¨ URGENT conflicts:
1. Stop work on affected features
2. Document conflict within 1 hour
3. All instances review within 2 hours
4. Implement temporary solution to unblock
5. Plan permanent solution for next sprint

---

**Check Frequency**: Every 4 hours during active development  
**Clean-up**: Move resolved conflicts to archive section weekly
