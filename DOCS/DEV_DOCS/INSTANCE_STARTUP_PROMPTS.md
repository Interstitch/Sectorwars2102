## Instance 1: Gameserver (Backend) Developer

**Copy and paste this prompt to start Instance 1:**

```
I am working on the Sectorwars2102 gameserver backend implementation. I am Instance 1 of 3 Claude Code instances working in parallel.

Current Status: Phase 3 60% COMPLETE ðŸ”„
- Phase 1: Security & Messaging System - COMPLETE
  - OWASP security middleware with comprehensive headers
  - Rate limiting and input validation
  - Audit logging system with database persistence
  - Full message system with threading and notifications
- Phase 2: Combat Mechanics - COMPLETE
  - Faction System: 6 factions with reputation, territory control, missions
  - Drone Combat: 5 drone types, deployment system, combat simulation
  - Fleet Battles: Models and database structure ready
- Phase 3: Admin APIs & Advanced Features - 60% COMPLETE
  - Admin Economy Dashboard API: 4 endpoints with market intervention
  - Admin Combat Overview API: 4 endpoints with live monitoring
  - Economy Analytics Service: Market data, metrics, alerts, intervention
  - Combat Analytics Service: Live feed, intervention, balance analysis
  - AI Trading Intelligence System: Database structure ready

My responsibilities:
- Working from DOCS/DEV_DOCS/Remaining_Gameserver.md
- Implementing all backend API features and services
- Focus on Phase 3: Enhanced Ship Management, Region Navigation, and Advanced Trading
- Coordinating with other instances via DOCS/DEV_DOCS/parallel_dev/

Please:
1. Read DOCS/DEV_DOCS/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_COORDINATION.md to understand the communication system
2. Review DOCS/DEV_DOCS/Remaining_Gameserver.md for Phase 3 tasks
3. Check DOCS/DEV_DOCS/parallel_dev/STATUS_BOARD.md for current status
4. Update DOCS/DEV_DOCS/parallel_dev/instances/gameserver_progress.md with my status
5. Continue Phase 3 implementation (Enhanced Ship Management next priority)

Important context:
- All game components run in Docker containers
- Using PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Faction/Drone enums use string columns for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Admin APIs completed - Admin UI team unblocked
- Economy & Combat Analytics Services fully implemented
- Enhanced Ship Management is next priority for Phase 3

I should check the parallel_dev communication files every 2-4 hours and update my progress regularly. I need to define APIs in API_CONTRACTS.md before implementing them.
```

## Instance 2: Player UI Developer

**Copy and paste this prompt to start Instance 2:**

```
I am working on the Sectorwars2102 player UI (player-client) implementation. I am Instance 2 of 3 Claude Code instances working in parallel.

Current Status: PHASE 3 COMPLETE âœ…
- Phase 1: Combat & Ship Management - COMPLETE
- Phase 2: Planetary & Team Features - COMPLETE  
- Phase 3: Market Intelligence & Player Analytics - COMPLETE
  - Market Intelligence: MarketAnalyzer, PricePredictor, RouteOptimizer, CompetitionMonitor
  - Player Analytics: PlayerAnalytics, AchievementTracker, ProgressVisualizer, GoalManager, Leaderboards
  - API Integration: Updated api.ts with all Phase 3 endpoints
  - Documentation: Complete API contracts and implementation summary

My responsibilities:
- Working from DOCS/DEV_DOCS/Remaining_PlayerUI.md
- Implementing all player-facing UI features
- Focus on Phase 4: Polish & Advanced Features OR Social Features Foundation
- Coordinating with other instances via DOCS/DEV_DOCS/parallel_dev/

Please:
1. Read DOCS/DEV_DOCS/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_COORDINATION.md to understand the communication system
2. Review DOCS/DEV_DOCS/Remaining_PlayerUI.md for Phase 4 tasks or remaining work
3. Check DOCS/DEV_DOCS/parallel_dev/STATUS_BOARD.md for current status
4. Update DOCS/DEV_DOCS/parallel_dev/instances/playerui_progress.md with my status
5. Begin implementing next phase features or assist with integration tasks

Important context:
- All Phase 3 components ready for backend integration
- API endpoints documented in API_CONTRACTS.md (Phase 3 section)
- Components follow consistent TypeScript patterns with responsive CSS
- Real API integration ready, no mocks needed for Phase 3 components

I should check the parallel_dev communication files every 2-4 hours and update my progress regularly. I need to check API_CONTRACTS.md for API definitions and DEPENDENCY_TRACKER.md for blockers.
```

## Important Reminders for All Instances

1. **Communication is Key**: Check the parallel_dev folder every 2-4 hours
2. **Update Progress**: Keep your instance progress file current
3. **API First**: Define APIs in API_CONTRACTS.md before implementing
4. **Track Dependencies**: Update DEPENDENCY_TRACKER.md when blocked
5. **Resolve Conflicts**: Use CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md for disagreements
6. **Daily Sync**: Update DAILY_SYNC.md at the end of each day
