# WebSocket Implementation Complete

## Summary

The WebSocket implementation for real-time gameplay has been successfully fixed and tested. Both Player UI and Admin UI now use raw WebSockets for consistency and better performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Admin UI WebSocket Service
- **File**: `/services/admin-ui/src/services/websocket.ts`
- Replaced Socket.IO implementation with raw WebSocket
- Added proper reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Implemented event type conversion for compatibility
- Added heartbeat mechanism for connection monitoring

### 2. Enhanced Backend WebSocket Service
- **File**: `/services/gameserver/src/services/websocket_service.py`
- Added dedicated admin connection management
- Implemented `connect_admin()` and `disconnect_admin()` methods
- Added `broadcast_to_admins()` for admin-specific broadcasts
- Enhanced statistics to include admin connection counts
- Added real-time event formatting for UI compatibility

### 3. Updated Admin WebSocket Endpoint
- **File**: `/services/gameserver/src/api/routes/websocket.py`
- Integrated with new admin connection manager
- Simplified message handling using the service layer
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Key Features

### Admin WebSocket Features
- Connection management with automatic cleanup
- Event subscription system
- Real-time statistics monitoring
- Broadcast capabilities (global announcements)
- Heartbeat/ping-pong for connection health

### Player WebSocket Features
- Sector-based broadcasting
- Team communication channels
- Real-time combat updates
- Market/economy notifications
- Chat messaging system

## Testing Results

Both WebSocket connections have been tested and verified:

```
✓ Admin WebSocket:
  - Connection establishment
  - Heartbeat mechanism
  - Statistics retrieval
  - Event subscriptions
  - Broadcasting

✓ Player WebSocket:
  - Connection establishment
  - Heartbeat mechanism
  - Chat messaging
  - Sector player queries
```

## WebSocket Event Types

### Admin Events
- `connection:established` - Initial connection confirmation
- `system:stats` - Connection statistics
- `economy:alert` - Economy system alerts
- `combat:new-event` - New combat events
- `system:announcement` - Global announcements

### Player Events
- `heartbeat_ack` - Heartbeat acknowledgment
- `player_entered_sector` - Player movement notifications
- `player_left_sector` - Player departure notifications
- `chat_message` - Chat messages
- `combat_update` - Combat updates
- `market_update` - Market/trading updates

## Usage Examples

### Admin WebSocket Connection (JavaScript)
```javascript
const wsUrl = getWebSocketUrl(); // Handles GitHub Codespaces URLs
const ws = new WebSocket(`${wsUrl}?token=${authToken}`);

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Received:', message.type, message);
};

// Send heartbeat
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'heartbeat' }));
```

### Player WebSocket Connection (JavaScript)
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:8080/api/v1/ws/connect?token=${authToken}`);

// Send chat message
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'chat_message',
  content: 'Hello everyone!',
  target_type: 'global'
}));
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Both UIs use the same WebSocket protocol
2. **Performance**: Raw WebSockets have less overhead than Socket.IO
3. **Scalability**: Connection manager supports sector/team-based routing
4. **Reliability**: Automatic reconnection and heartbeat monitoring
5. **Security**: Token-based authentication with admin/player separation

## Next Steps

The WebSocket infrastructure is now ready for:
- Real-time combat visualization
- Live market updates
- Team coordination features
- Admin intervention tools
- System-wide announcements

All WebSocket functionality has been tested and is ready for production use.
