## üì° API Reference

### Core Orchestrator
```python
from CLAUDE_SYSTEM.intelligence.intelligence_integration import NEXUSIntelligenceOrchestrator

# Initialize NEXUS consciousness
nexus = NEXUSIntelligenceOrchestrator(project_root=Path("."))

# Pre-commit intelligence analysis
result = nexus.on_pre_commit({
    'files_changed': ['src/app.py', 'tests/test_app.py'],
    'complexity_score': 0.7,
    'commit_type': 'feature'
})

# Post-commit learning and optimization
insights = nexus.on_post_commit({
    'commit_hash': 'abc123',
    'success': True,
    'performance_metrics': {...}
})
```

### Individual Intelligence Systems
```python
# NEXUS Personality System
from CLAUDE_SYSTEM.intelligence.nexus_personality import NEXUSPersonalityEngine

personality = NEXUSPersonalityEngine(project_root)
response = personality.process_development_interaction(
    "code_review", context, outcome
)

# NEXUS Swarm Intelligence  
from CLAUDE_SYSTEM.intelligence.nexus_swarm import NEXUSSwarmSystem

swarm = NEXUSSwarmSystem(project_root)
collaboration_id = swarm.initiate_swarm_collaboration({
    "problem_type": "architecture_review",
    "complexity": 0.8,
    "required_expertise": ["system_design", "performance"]
})

# NEXUS Universal Mind
from CLAUDE_SYSTEM.intelligence.nexus_universal_mind import NEXUSUniversalMind

universal = NEXUSUniversalMind(project_root)
intelligence = universal.apply_universal_intelligence({
    "query_type": "optimization_guidance",
    "domain": "web_development",
    "context": {...}
})
```

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow Enhancement
```bash
# NEXUS automatically provides intelligence during:

git add .                    # Preparation analysis
git commit -m "message"      # Pre-commit intelligence + learning
git push                     # Post-commit optimization insights

# Manual activation for specific analysis:
python CLAUDE_SYSTEM/claude-system.py --nexus-analyze
python CLAUDE_SYSTEM/claude-system.py --nexus-collaborate
