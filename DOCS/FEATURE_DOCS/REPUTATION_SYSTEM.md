# Reputation System

## Overview

The Sector Wars 2102 reputation system tracks a player's standing with six major factions that control different regions of space. Your reputation affects trading prices, mission availability, port access, and defensive responses when entering controlled sectors. Each faction tracks reputation on a scale from -8 to +8.

## Reputation Levels

Each faction tracks reputation on a scale from -8 to +8, with finer gradations for nuanced progression:

| Level | Title | Range |
|-------|-------|-------|
| -8 | Public Enemy | -800 to -701 |
| -7 | Criminal | -700 to -601 |
| -6 | Outlaw | -600 to -501 |
| -5 | Pirate | -500 to -401 |
| -4 | Smuggler | -400 to -301 |
| -3 | Untrustworthy | -300 to -201 |
| -2 | Suspicious | -200 to -101 |
| -1 | Questionable | -100 to -1 |
| 0 | Neutral | 0 |
| +1 | Recognized | 1 to 100 |
| +2 | Acknowledged | 101 to 200 |
| +3 | Trusted | 201 to 300 |
| +4 | Respected | 301 to 400 |
| +5 | Valued | 401 to 500 |
| +6 | Honored | 501 to 600 |
| +7 | Revered | 601 to 700 |
| +8 | Exalted | 701 to 800 |

## Changing Reputation

### Gaining Reputation
- Completing missions for the faction
- Trading at faction-controlled ports
- Defending faction assets from attackers
- Eliminating faction enemies
- Donating credits or resources to faction causes
- Returning lost ships or cargo

### Losing Reputation
- Attacking faction ships or stations
- Smuggling illegal goods in faction territory
- Stealing faction resources
- Failing faction missions
- Supporting rival factions in conflicts
- Colonizing planets claimed by the faction

## Reputation Decay
Reputation naturally decays toward neutral (0) at a rate of 1 point per week of inactivity with that faction. Active negative actions against a faction will halt this decay process.

## Faction Relations
Factions have relationships with each other, meaning reputation gains with one faction may result in reputation losses with rival factions:

- **Allies:** Terran Federation and Nova Scientific Institute
- **Friendly:** Mercantile Guild and Astral Mining Consortium
- **Rivals:** Frontier Coalition and Terran Federation
- **Enemies:** Fringe Alliance and Terran Federation, Nova Scientific Institute

## Strategic Considerations

### Reputation Balance
Players must carefully balance their reputation with different factions, as it's nearly impossible to maintain maximum reputation with all factions simultaneously.

### Specialization
Specializing in 2-3 aligned factions provides the most efficient path to accessing high-level benefits and exclusive content.

### Reputation Recovery
Recovering from negative reputation requires significant effort. Players may purchase "diplomatic immunity" at neutral ports to reset reputation to 0 with a specific faction at a substantial credit cost.

### Team Impact
Team reputation is calculated using one of three methods (Average, Lowest, or Leader), making team composition and leadership critical strategic considerations when interacting with faction-controlled space. Teams are treated as unified diplomatic entities by all factions, with reputation-based benefits or penalties applying to all team members equally. See the Team Systems documentation for detailed information on team reputation mechanics.

## Credit/Time Sink
- Reputation recovery costs: 10,000 credits per negative point to reset to neutral
- Diplomatic missions require turn investment to complete
- Faction ships require both credits and positive reputation to purchase
- Exclusive faction technology requires continued reputation maintenance
