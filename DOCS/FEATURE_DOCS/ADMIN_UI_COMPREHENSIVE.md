```

### Navigation Architecture

The admin UI uses a hierarchical navigation structure with the main sidebar providing access to all administrative functions:

- **Dashboard** - Overview and quick access
- **User Management** - Basic user administration

### Styling and Design

All components follow a consistent dark theme design system:

- **Color Scheme**: Dark blue/gray palette (`#0a0f1c`, `#1e293b`, `#374151`)
- **Accent Colors**: Blue (`#3b82f6`), Green (`#10b981`), Orange (`#f59e0b`), Red (`#ef4444`)
- **Typography**: Clean, modern fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Components**: Card-based layout with subtle shadows and borders
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design with adaptive layouts

### State Management

Each component manages its own state with the following patterns:

- **Loading states** for asynchronous data fetching
- **Error handling** with user-friendly error messages
- **Real-time updates** with periodic data refresh
- **Modal interfaces** for detailed views and editing
- **Filter and search** capabilities for large datasets

## API Integration

The admin UI is designed to integrate with backend API endpoints:

### Required Endpoints

```typescript
// Economy Management
GET /api/admin/economy/market-data
GET /api/admin/economy/metrics
GET /api/admin/economy/alerts
POST /api/admin/economy/intervention

// Player Analytics
GET /api/admin/players/analytics
GET /api/admin/players/metrics
POST /api/admin/players/{id}/action
POST /api/admin/players/{id}/credits

// Combat Overview
GET /api/admin/combat/logs
GET /api/admin/combat/stats
GET /api/admin/combat/balance
POST /api/admin/combat/{id}/resolve

// Fleet Management
GET /api/admin/ships/all
GET /api/admin/ships/stats
POST /api/admin/ships/{id}/action
POST /api/admin/ships/{id}/teleport
POST /api/admin/ships/{id}/repair
```

## Security & Permissions

All admin functions are protected by:

- **JWT Authentication** - Required for all admin operations
- **Role-based Access Control** - Admin-only routes and functions
- **Protected Routes** - All admin pages require authentication
- **Audit Logging** - All admin actions should be logged for accountability

## Usage Guidelines

### For Game Administrators

1. **Daily Monitoring**
   - Check Economy Dashboard for market anomalies
   - Review Player Analytics for suspicious activity
   - Monitor Combat Overview for balance issues
   - Verify Fleet Management for stuck or lost ships

2. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Use Economy intervention tools for market crashes
   - Deploy Emergency Events for crisis management
   - Use Combat dispute resolution for player conflicts
   - Utilize Ship emergency operations for player support

3. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Review Analytics Reports for optimization opportunities
   - Update Team Management for faction rebalancing
   - Monitor Colonization Overview for expansion patterns
   - Check Event Management for seasonal content updates

### Performance Considerations

- **Real-time updates** refresh data every 30 seconds by default
- **Large datasets** use pagination and filtering
- **Chart rendering** uses efficient visualization libraries
- **Modal dialogs** lazy-load detailed information
- **Responsive design** adapts to different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Advanced Charting** - Integration with Chart.js or D3.js for interactive visualizations
