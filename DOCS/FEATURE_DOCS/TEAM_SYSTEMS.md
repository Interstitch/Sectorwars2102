# Team Systems

## Overview

Team Systems in Sector Wars 2102 allow players to form strategic alliances, creating a dynamic layer of cooperation in the game universe. These teams transform the solo experience into coordinated fleet operations, enabling players to share resources, gain tactical advantages, and communicate securely as they compete for dominance across the sectors.

## Core Features

### Team Formation

- **Team Size**: Teams consist of 4 players, providing an optimal balance between coordination and manageability
- **Creation Cost**: Establishing a new team requires 10,000 credits, representing a significant investment
- **Team Numbers**: Teams are identified by numbers 1-9, making them easily recognizable in the game world
- **Joining Process**: Players can join teams through invitation when in the same physical sector
- **Cooldown Period**: 24-hour waiting period between leaving one team and joining another

### Resource Sharing

- **Drone Redistribution**: Combat units can be shared between team members for tactical advantage
- **Commodity Exchange**: Trading goods can be transferred to optimize market operations
- **Location Requirements**: Players must be in the same sector to exchange resources
- **Transfer Limits**: Maximum caps on resource transfers prevent exploitation
- **Escape Pod Docking**: Team members can dock their escape pods with teammate ships for rescue operations

> **Note**: All players, regardless of team membership, can send credits to any other player via the in-game mail system. This universal credit transfer system is independent of team mechanics.

### Combat Advantages

- **Statistical Edge**: Team members gain a 60/40 advantage ratio when engaging non-team opponents
- **Drone Coordination**: Multiple team members can coordinate drone deployments in combat
- **Friendly Fire Prevention**: Team members cannot accidentally damage each other in combat
- **Coordinated Attack Bonuses**: Escalating advantages when multiple team members attack together
- **Defensive Notifications**: Automatic alerts when team members are under attack

### Team Communication

- **Private Channel**: Team-only messaging provides secure strategic coordination
- **Member Tracking**: Real-time awareness of team member locations across sectors
- **Event Broadcasting**: Automatic notifications for significant team-related events
- **Cross-Sector Coordination**: Communication remains available regardless of physical location
- **Message History**: Complete archive of team communications for reference

### Team Management

- **Leadership Role**: Team founders automatically become leaders with management privileges
- **Member Management**: Leaders can invite new members and remove existing ones
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor team member activity and contributions to the group
- **Strategic Planning**: Set objectives and coordinate movements across multiple sectors
- **Team Dissolution**: Leaders can disband the team if necessary

## Game Balance Considerations

- **Team Size Limit**: The 4-player maximum ensures teams don't become overpowering
- **Resource Transfer Restrictions**: Physical proximity requirements for drone and commodity transfers maintain realism
- **Universal Credit Access**: All players have equal access to credit transfers via mail, regardless of team status
- **Individual Progression**: Team members continue to advance individually despite shared goals
- **Sector Limitations**: Certain protected sectors have restrictions on team advantages
- **Solo Player Viability**: Non-team players maintain competitive options through other gameplay advantages

## Strategic Dimensions

### Defensive Strategies

- Teams can establish defensive perimeters around valuable sectors
- Coordinated drone positioning creates efficient sector coverage
- Rapid response to threats through team alerts and positioning
- Resource pooling to quickly rebuild defenses after attacks
- Rescue operations for stranded teammates in escape pods

### Offensive Operations

- Drone concentration to overwhelm strong defensive positions
- Tactical diversions and flanking maneuvers
- Intelligence gathering through team member scouting

## Player Experience

### Team Interface

- Team management panel showing all members and their status
- Resource transfer controls with validation and confirmation
- Team chat interface with history and notification options
- Strategic map with team member locations highlighted

## Team Reputation

Teams have a collective reputation with each of the six major factions, influencing diplomatic relations, trade terms, and access to faction territories:

- **Calculation Methods**: Teams can select one of three reputation calculation methods:
  - **Average** (Default): All members' reputation values are averaged
  - **Lowest**: The lowest member's reputation is used for the entire team
  - **Leader**: The team leader's reputation is used for the entire team

- **Strategic Implications**:
  - Team composition directly impacts diplomatic relations with all factions
  - Reputation-based access to services and territories applies team-wide
  - All members receive the benefits or penalties of the team's calculated reputation
  - Changing calculation method requires a 7-day cooldown period to prevent exploitation

- **Faction Interactions**:
  - Factions treat teams as unified diplomatic entities
  - Trade pricing and mission availability are determined by team reputation
  - Port access and defensive responses apply to all team members equally
  - Team actions affect faction relations in the same way as individual actions

## Design Philosophy

The team system is designed to enhance the game's strategic depth while maintaining balance and individual agency. Teams provide meaningful advantages that reward coordination but never become mandatory for competitive play. The system creates emergent gameplay through dynamic group interactions while preserving the core trading and combat experiences that define Sector Wars 2102.
