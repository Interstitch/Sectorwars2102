# Planetary Defense System — Sector Wars 2102

This document describes the planetary defense mechanics for Sector Wars 2102. It covers citadels, shields, drones, landing rights, and defensive buildings.

## Overview

Planets can be fortified to resist attacks and protect resources and colonists. Defense is multi-layered, combining static structures, stationed drones, and access controls.

## Citadel System

- **Citadel Level:** Determines base defense, storage capacity, and unlocks advanced features.
- **Upgrade Path:** Levels 1-5, each level increases defense and storage.
- **Initial Level:** 
  - Level 1 for standard colonization and basic Genesis Device creation
  - Level 2 automatically for planets created via Colony Ship sacrifice (5 Genesis Devices)
- **Destruction:** If a planet's citadel is destroyed, the planet is permanently lost.

## Shield Mechanics

- **Shield Level:** 0–10, each level adds 1,000 shield strength.
- **Regeneration:** Shields regenerate at 10% of max per hour.
- **Upgrades:** Shield upgrades cost credits and require a minimum citadel level.

## Drone Deployment

- **Stationed Drones:** Players can deploy drones to defend their planet.
- **Effectiveness:** Planet-based drones have a 5% defense bonus over ship-based drones.
- **Limits:** Maximum number of drones is determined by citadel level:
  - Level 1: Up to 10 drones
  - Level 2: Up to 25 drones (initial capacity for Genesis Ship sacrifice colonies)
  - Level 3: Up to 50 drones
  - Level 4: Up to 100 drones
  - Level 5: Up to 200 drones
- **Deployment:** Drones must be purchased and transported to the planet before deployment.

## Landing Rights

- **Access Control:** Owners can grant or deny landing rights to teams or individual players.
- **Team Rights:** Option to allow all team members to land.
- **Deny List:** Explicitly block certain players.

## Defensive Buildings

- **Types:**
  - **Defense Grid:** Increases drone effectiveness.
  - **Scanner Array:** Early warning of attacks.
  - **Shield Generator:** Increases shield regeneration.
- **Upgrades:** Buildings can be upgraded for greater effect.

## Ownership Transfer

- **Rules:**
  - Only the owner can transfer ownership.
  - Recipient must accept the transfer.
  - Transfer fee applies (5% of planet value).
  - All defenses and upgrades transfer.

## Attack & Destruction

- **Attackers:** Must overcome shields, drones, and citadel.
- **Destruction:** If citadel is destroyed, planet is lost.
- **Resource Theft:** Attackers may steal resources if successful.

## Genesis-Created Planets

Planets created through Genesis Devices have special defensive considerations:

- **Basic Genesis (1 Device):** 
  - Standard Level 1 Citadel
  - Basic defensive capabilities only
  
- **Enhanced Genesis (3 Devices):** 
  - Standard Level 1 Citadel
  - Same defensive capabilities as standard colonization
  
- **Advanced Genesis (Colony Ship Sacrifice, 5 Devices):**
  - Starts with Level 2 Citadel automatically
  - Initial drone capacity of 25 (vs. 10 for standard colonies)
  - Shield generator pre-installed with Level 1 shield (1,000 shield strength)
  - Basic automated turret system already constructed (4 turrets)
  - These head-start defensive capabilities make the Colony Ship sacrifice particularly valuable in contested regions
