# Sector Defense System

## Overview

The Sector Defense System is a strategic gameplay feature in Sector Wars 2102 that allows players to deploy drones and other defensive measures to secure valuable sectors throughout the galaxy. By establishing defensive positions, players can claim territories, establish protective perimeters, and protect their economic interests from rival players.

## Core Mechanics

### Defensive Options

Players have several options for defending sectors:

1. **Deployed Drones**: Transfer drones from your ship to the sector
2. **Port Defenses**: Ports you own have built-in defensive capabilities
3. **Planetary Defenses**: Owned planets provide defensive coverage to their sectors
4. **Defensive Mines**: Deploy mine fields in strategic locations
5. **Stationed Drones**: Special autonomous drones that patrol sectors
6. **Rented NPC Defenders**: Hire mercenary ships for temporary defense

### Drone Deployment

Players can deploy their ship's drones to sectors using the following rules:

- **Deployment Cost**: Drones are transferred from your ship to the sector
- **Location Restrictions**: 
  - Drones cannot be deployed in Stardock sectors (sectors 1-7)
  - Drones can only be deployed in the sector your ship currently occupies
- **Ownership**: Only one player can have drones deployed in a sector at a time
- **Visibility**: All players who enter a sector can see how many drones are deployed there and who owns them

### Deployment Process

To deploy drones to a sector:

1. Navigate to the sector where you want to establish a defense
2. Access the Drone Management screen
3. Specify the number of drones to deploy (cannot exceed your ship's current drone count)
4. Confirm deployment

Once deployed, drones remain in the sector until they are:
- Retrieved by the owning player
- Destroyed in combat by another player
- Automatically recalled (if enabled)

### Drone Retrieval

Players can retrieve their drones from sectors they control:

1. Navigate to the sector containing your drones
2. Access the Drone Management screen
3. Specify how many drones to retrieve (partial retrieval is allowed)
4. Confirm retrieval

**Limitations**:
- You must be physically present in the sector to retrieve drones
- Your ship must have sufficient capacity to hold the retrieved drones
- Retrieval is instantaneous with no delay

## Strategic Benefits

### Territorial Control

Deploying defenses to a sector provides several strategic advantages:

- **Sector Ownership**: The sector is marked as controlled by your player/team
- **Early Warning**: You receive notification when other players enter your controlled sector
- **Resource Priority**: Controlled sectors provide additional resource gathering benefits
- **Team Support**: Allies can navigate through your controlled sectors safely

### Economic Protection

Strategic defense deployment protects economic interests:

- **Trade Route Security**: Deploying defenses along trade routes protects your shipping lanes
- **Port Protection**: Defending sectors with valuable ports ensures trading advantages
- **Planet Security**: Defending sectors with your colonies prevents unwanted visitors
- **Mining Security**: Protecting resource-rich sectors from competitors

## Combat Interactions

### Sector Defense Challenges

When a player enters a sector with enemy defenses:

1. The entering player is notified of the defensive presence
2. The sector owner receives an alert that their sector has a visitor
3. The entering player must decide to:
   - Proceed peacefully (no combat)
   - Attack the defending forces
   - Leave the sector

### Drone Combat Mechanics

When attacking sector drones, the following rules apply:

- **Combat Initiation**: The attacking player must explicitly choose to attack the drones
- **Defender Bonus**: Deployed drones receive a 5% defensive bonus compared to shipboard drones
- **Combat Resolution**: Combat follows the standard drone exchange system (see below)
- **Outcome Notification**: If drones are destroyed, the sector owner receives immediate notification

### Drone Exchange System

Drone combat uses a probabilistic exchange system:

1. **Exchange Calculation**: Each drone engagement is calculated individually
2. **Base Hit Probability**: 50% chance for attacker or defender to win each exchange
3. **Modifiers Apply**: Combat bonuses from ships, upgrades, and team advantages modify these probabilities
4. **Sequential Resolution**: Exchanges continue until one side has no remaining drones
5. **Partial Destruction**: The winning side retains their remaining drones

Example:
- Attacker: 20 drones (no bonuses)
- Defender: 15 drones (5% defense bonus from sector deployment)
- Expected outcome: Equal losses until one side is eliminated, with a slight advantage to the defender

## Sector Defense Management

### Defense Network Strategy

Players can create sector defense networks by:

- **Critical Path Defense**: Securing key navigation chokepoints
- **Perimeter Defense**: Creating a defensive boundary around valuable areas
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: Heavily defending a central sector with lighter defenses in adjacent sectors
- **Trip Wire System**: Placing minimal defenses in many sectors as an early warning system

### Defense Optimization

To optimize your sector defense:

- **Concentration Analysis**: Defense strength should match the sector's strategic value
- **Drone Allocation**: Balance between ship combat readiness and sector defense needs
- **Response Planning**: Maintain reserve ships near valuable sectors for quick response
- **Team Coordination**: Coordinate defense responsibilities with team members

## Advanced Features

### Automated Defense Systems

As players advance, they can unlock automated defense features:

- **Drone Recall**: Automatically retrieve drones when an overwhelming force enters the sector
- **Defense Reinforcement**: Automatically deploy additional drones from nearby sectors when under attack
- **Early Warning Network**: Automatically notify team members when a sector is under attack
- **Defense Analysis**: AI recommendations for optimal drone allocation across controlled sectors

### Team Defense Coordination

Teams can coordinate sector defense for greater effectiveness:

- **Shared Defense Duties**: Different team members can be responsible for different regions
- **Defense Rotation**: Team members can take turns maintaining critical sector defenses
- **Coordinated Response**: Team-wide alerts when defended sectors are under attack
- **Strategic Reserve**: Team drone pools for rapid response to threats

## Economic Considerations

### Maintenance Costs

Maintaining sector defenses has economic implications:

- **Opportunity Cost**: Drones deployed to sectors are unavailable for ship defense
- **Strategic Value**: Balance between defending sectors and maintaining combat readiness
- **Economic Denial**: Preventing competitors from accessing valuable economic sectors
- **Risk Assessment**: Higher-value sectors warrant stronger defenses

### Return on Investment

Effective sector defense provides return on investment through:

- **Secured Trade Routes**: Safe passage for commodities trading
- **Resource Protection**: Exclusive access to mining and resource collection
- **Territorial Dominance**: Control over strategic regions
- **Reputation Benefits**: Recognition as a powerful force in the galaxy

## UI and Notifications

### Defense Management Interface

The Sector Defense interface provides:

- **Defense Map**: Visual representation of your controlled sectors
- **Drone Distribution**: Current drone allocation across all controlled sectors
- **Alert Status**: Real-time status of all your defended sectors
- **Quick Deploy/Retrieve**: Streamlined interface for drone management

### Notification System

Players receive alerts about their defended sectors:

- **Incursion Alert**: Notification when a player enters your defended sector
- **Attack Warning**: High-priority alert when your defenses are under attack
- **Sector Lost**: Notification when all your defenses in a sector are destroyed
- **Defense Report**: Daily summary of your sector defense network status
