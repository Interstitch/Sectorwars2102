# First Login Experience

## Overview

The First Login Experience establishes the player's identity, starting resources, and introduces them to the game world through an interactive narrative sequence. This feature uses AI-powered natural language processing to create a dynamic, personalized onboarding experience. Players begin in Sector 1 at a spaceport on Earth with 1000 credits and an escape pod.

## Core Concepts

- **Narrative Introduction**: Players begin in a shipyard scenario where they must convince a guard of their identity
- **Character Creation**: Players establish their pilot name and starting ship through dialogue choices
- **AI-Powered Dialogue**: NPC interactions leverage LLM APIs for flexible conversation analysis
- **Variable Outcomes**: Different dialogue paths lead to different starting resources and ships

## Narrative Flow

### Setting

The player has just created their account and logged in for the first time. Instead of a traditional character creation screen, they are immediately immersed in a narrative scenario at a spaceport on Earth (Sector 1):

> The year is 2102. You find yourself in a bustling shipyard on the outskirts of the Callisto Colony. Your memory is hazy—a side effect of the cryo-sleep required for the journey here. A small orange cat darts between the landing gear of nearby ships, disappearing into the shadows. You're approaching what appears to be your escape pod when a stern-looking Security Guard blocks your path.

### Dialogue Sequence

1. **Initial Confrontation**:
   - The Guard asks: "Hold it right there! This area is restricted to registered pilots only. Which of these vessels belongs to you?" (Three ships are displayed: a sleek Scout Ship, a bulky Cargo Freighter, and a small Escape Pod)

2. **Ship Selection**:
   - Player can claim any of the three ships through dialogue response
   - Each ship choice influences starting resources and capabilities:
     - **Scout Ship**: Fast with good sensors, low cargo (2000 credits)
     - **Cargo Freighter**: Slow but spacious, good for trading (5000 credits)
     - **Escape Pod**: Basic capabilities but highly maneuverable (1000 credits)

3. **Dynamic Challenge Questions**:
   - Guard's verification questions are generated dynamically by AI based on player choices and context
   - Questions adapt to the player's claimed ship type, responses, and behavior
   - Example questioning paths:
     - Identity verification: "What's your pilot registration name?", "What's your clearance code for this sector?"
     - Arrival details: "When did you dock at this station?", "Who processed your landing clearance?"
     - Ship-specific questions: "What's your cargo manifest?", "What's the maximum warp capacity of your vessel?"
     - Situational awareness: "Why is your ship in the restricted docking area?", "Do you have authorization for the outer rim transit lanes?"
   
4. **Negotiation Skill Check**:
   - Guard notices: "You're trying to persuade me to let you take a nicer ship, aren't you?"
   - Player's negotiation skill is evaluated based on:
     - Confidence in responses
     - Consistency in story details
     - Convincing rationale provided
   - If player shows strong negotiation skills:
     - 25% bonus to persuasion success to obtain better ships
     - Flag set for future trade advantages in the game
   - If player shows weak negotiation skills:
     - Guard becomes more suspicious of all claims
     - Reduced chance of success in obtaining nicer ships

5. **Resolution**:
   - Guard either:
     - Believes the player and grants access to the claimed ship
     - Recognizes the deception about Scout Ship or Cargo Freighter and says:
       - "Wait a minute... these records show you're actually registered to the Escape Pod. Your story doesn't add up at all."
       - "Trying to steal a better ship, are we? Nice try. Get back to your Escape Pod before I call security."
     - Catches the player in a lie but offers a "second chance" with reduced starting credits

## Technical Implementation

### AI Integration ✅ ENHANCED (2025-05-24)

The First Login experience features a robust multi-provider AI system with intelligent fallback chains and enhanced manual simulation.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Enhanced (2025-05-24)
**AI Providers**: OpenAI GPT (primary), Anthropic Claude (secondary), Enhanced Manual (fallback)
**Provider Priority**: OpenAI-first for cost efficiency, Anthropic for quality backup
**Fallback Strategy**: Sophisticated rule-based analysis with cat boost and ship tier logic
**Documentation**: See `/DOCS/DEV_DOCS/AI_POWERED_FIRST_LOGIN_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

#### Enhanced Provider System Features
- **Cost Optimization**: OpenAI used as primary provider (cheaper for dialogue)
- **Quality Assurance**: Anthropic Claude as high-quality secondary fallback
- **Zero Downtime**: Enhanced manual provider ensures service continuity
- **Cat Boost Mechanic**: 15% persuasion boost for mentioning the orange cat ✅
- **Ship Tier Difficulty**: Dynamic guard skepticism based on claimed ship value ✅
- **Provider Tracking**: Full visibility into which AI system generated each response

#### Dynamic Guard Questioning ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The security guard's questioning adapts dynamically based on:

- The type of ship the player claims (Scout Ship, Cargo Freighter, Escape Pod)
- Previous player responses and detected inconsistencies
- Player behavior and response patterns
- Time of day and current security protocols
- Whether the player demonstrates negotiation skill

The guard will probe different aspects of the player's story:
- Identity verification (registration, clearance codes)
- Arrival details (docking time, processing officers)
- Ship-specific knowledge (technical specifications, cargo capacity)
- Situational awareness (current protocols, restricted areas)

As the conversation progresses, the guard becomes more skeptical of inconsistent answers, asking increasingly challenging follow-up questions targeted at exposing contradictions.

#### Response Analysis ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The system analyzes player responses using AI to determine:
- **Persuasiveness** (how believable their story is)
- **Confidence Level** (how sure they sound)
- **Consistency** (matches with previous claims)
- **Negotiation Skill** (quality of their persuasion tactics)
- **Inconsistencies** (contradictions in their story)
- **Key Information** (extracted claims and player name)
- **Overall Believability** (comprehensive assessment)

**AI Features**:
- Context-aware analysis considering full dialogue history
- Dynamic inconsistency detection across multiple exchanges
- Sophisticated negotiation skill assessment
- Adaptive guard mood suggestions

**Enhanced Fallback Logic**: When AI services are unavailable, the system uses an sophisticated enhanced manual provider that includes:
- **Cat Boost Detection**: Automatically detects cat mentions and applies 15% persuasion boost
- **Ship Tier Scaling**: Adjusts guard skepticism based on claimed ship value/rarity  
- **Dynamic Personality**: Simulates realistic guard behavior with contextual responses
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced rule-based analysis rivaling AI quality

### Enhanced Decision Matrix

The decision matrix now incorporates ship tier difficulty and cat boost mechanics:

| Ship Choice | Base Tier | Cat Boost | Negotiation | Final Threshold | Success Outcome |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Escape Pod | Tier 1 (0.3) | +15% if mentioned | Any | 0.3 → 0.45 | Escape Pod + 1000 credits |
| Light Freighter | Tier 2 (0.5) | +15% if mentioned | Strong | 0.5 → 0.65 | Light Freighter + 2500 credits |
| Scout Ship | Tier 3 (0.6) | +15% if mentioned | Strong | 0.6 → 0.75 | Scout Ship + 2000 credits |
| Cargo Hauler | Tier 4 (0.7) | +15% if mentioned | Strong | 0.7 → 0.85 | Cargo Hauler + 5000 credits |
| Defender | Tier 5 (0.8) | +15% if mentioned | Strong | 0.8 → 0.95 | Defender + 7000 credits |

**Special Mechanics**:
- **Cat Boost**: Mentioning the orange cat provides a significant persuasion advantage
- **Ship Tier Scaling**: Higher-value ships require proportionally higher persuasion scores
- **Provider Fallback**: If AI providers fail, enhanced manual logic maintains quality experience
- **Failure Outcome**: All failed attempts default to Escape Pod + 500 credits

### Environment Configuration

The AI provider system can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
# AI Provider Configuration
AI_PROVIDER_PRIMARY=openai           # Primary provider (openai/anthropic)
AI_PROVIDER_SECONDARY=anthropic      # Secondary fallback
AI_PROVIDER_FALLBACK=manual          # Final fallback (always manual)

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key    # Required for OpenAI provider
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key    # Required for Anthropic provider

# Model Selection
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo          # OpenAI model to use
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-sonnet-20240229  # Anthropic model to use

# Feature Toggles
AI_DIALOGUE_ENABLED=true            # Enable/disable AI dialogue
```

**Provider Priority**: The system tries providers in order (Primary → Secondary → Manual) until one succeeds, ensuring zero service downtime even without API keys.

## UI/UX Considerations

1. **Immersive Presentation**:
   - Full-screen dialogue interface with shipyard background
   - Character portraits for the guard and player
   - Ship diagrams that highlight when discussed
   - Subtle animations for the environment

2. **Input Methods**:
   - Free-form text input for natural dialogue responses
   - Fallback option buttons for key decision points
   - Visual indicators for dialogue success/failure probability

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Voice narration option for all guard dialogue
   - Text size and contrast controls
   - Alternative input methods for players with disabilities

## Game Balance Considerations

- **Starting Resources**: The starting ships and credits are balanced to provide meaningful choice without overwhelming advantage
- **Persuasion Difficulty**: Thresholds are set to make higher-value ships harder to claim but not impossible
- **Negotiation Bonus**: Strong negotiation provides a significant but not decisive advantage
- **Failure State**: Even in worst-case outcomes, players receive minimally viable resources to begin gameplay
- **Notoriety Impact**: Players who attempt to deceive the guard but fail will incur a notoriety penalty that affects their early gameplay experience

## Future Enhancements

- **Tutorial Integration**: First login experience could naturally transition into core gameplay tutorials
- **Negotiation Skill Development**: Players could develop negotiation ability through in-game activities

## Mockup Dialogue

**Guard**: "Hold it right there! This area is restricted to registered pilots only. Which of these vessels belongs to you?"

**Player**: *[types free-form response]* "The Cargo Freighter is mine. I'm transporting supplies to the outer colonies."

*[AI analyzes response and generates contextual follow-up questions]*

**Guard**: "A freighter pilot, eh? What's your pilot registration name?"

**Player**: *[types free-form response]* "Captain Alex Morgan, Merchant Guild, Sector 7."

*[System notes player name as "Alex Morgan"]*

*[AI analyzes context: Player claims to be a freighter captain named Alex Morgan]*

**Guard**: "Interesting. All freighters must submit cargo manifests to station control before docking. What's your manifest authorization code?"

**Player**: *[types free-form response]* "MC-773-Alpha. You can verify with dock supervisor Kendricks. I docked during the night cycle."

*[AI detects a new claim about docking time and analyzes consistency]*

**Guard**: "Night cycle, you say? That's odd. The docking registry shows no freighters cleared during night cycle. And Kendricks was off-duty. Care to explain?"

**Player**: *[types free-form response]* "Yes there seems to be a system glitch. I have my own logs that show the docking time as 0300 hours. If you check with Operations instead of the main registry, you'll find the record."

*[AI analyzes dialogue - Player shows good negotiation skills with a confident workaround]*

**Guard**: "You've got quite a way with words. I can see you're experienced with bureaucratic... workarounds. Let me check with Operations." *[checks datapad]* "I see your clearance just came through. Must be that system glitch you mentioned. Go ahead, Captain Morgan. Your freighter is cleared for departure."

*[Player granted Cargo Freighter + 5000 credits with negotiation skill flag set to 'high']*

**Alternative Ending (Failed persuasion)**:

**Guard**: *[after several suspicious answers]* "Wait a minute..." *[taps on datapad]* "These records indicate you arrived on that escape pod over there. You're trying to claim someone else's freighter!"

**Player**: *[types free-form response]* "There must be some mistake in the system. I'm sure if you check again..."

**Guard**: "Save it. I've heard every excuse in the book. Look, I'm not calling security this time, but get back to your escape pod before I change my mind. And don't try something like this again."

*[Player forced to take Escape Pod + 500 credits]*
