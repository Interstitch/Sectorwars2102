- **Usage**: Required for establishing and growing planetary colonies
- **Transport**: Each population unit occupies one cargo space
- **Strategic Value**: The foundation of territorial expansion and passive income

### Quantum Shards
- **Description**: Crystalline fragments containing exotic energy patterns
- **Acquisition**: Found in nebula regions and anomalies throughout the frontier
- **Usage**: Component for creating Quantum Crystals when combined
- **Rarity**: Very rare, primarily in unexplored or dangerous regions
- **Strategic Value**: Five shards can be assembled into a single Quantum Crystal

### Quantum Crystals
- **Description**: Powerful energy matrices formed by combining Quantum Shards
- **Acquisition**: Created by assembling five Quantum Shards at specialized facilities
- **Usage**: Essential component for warp gate construction and advanced propulsion
- **Rarity**: Extremely rare due to the difficulty of collecting sufficient shards
- **Strategic Value**: Enables players to construct warp gates between distant sectors

## Rare Materials

A limited set of extremely valuable materials exist for advanced players to seek:


### Prismatic Ore
- **Description**: Mineral with unique molecular structure found in specific asteroid fields
- **Rarity Level**: Extremely rare (found in approximately 1 in 10,000 asteroids)
- **Primary Use**: Ultra-lightweight hull reinforcement and advanced ship construction

- **Strategic Value**: Dramatically improves ship detection and weapon capabilities
- **Acquisition Challenge**: Requires navigation through dangerous nebula clouds

## Resource Economy

### Port System

The galactic economy operates through specialized ports:

- **Class 0** (Sol Station): Sells all commodities, buys all commodities
- **Class 1**: Buys Ore, sells Basic Food, Fuel, Technology
- **Class 2**: Buys Basic Food, sells Ore, Fuel, Technology
- **Class 3**: Buys Fuel, sells Ore, Basic Food, Technology
- **Class 4**: Buys Technology, sells Ore, Basic Food, Fuel
- **Class 5**: Buys Luxury Goods, sells Ore, Basic Food, Fuel, Technology
- **Class 6**: Buys Ore and Basic Food, sells Fuel and Technology
- **Class 7**: Buys Fuel and Technology, sells Ore and Basic Food
- **Class 8**: Buys all commodities, sells nothing (Black Hole)
- **Class 9**: Sells all commodities, buys nothing (Nova)
- **Class 10**: Buys Gourmet Food, sells Technology and Luxury Goods
- **Class 11**: Buys Exotic Technology, sells advanced ship components and specialized equipment

### Market Dynamics

The value of resources follows economic principles:

- **Supply and Demand**: Prices adjust based on local availability and need
- **Regional Variations**: Different regions value resources differently
- **Distance Premium**: Goods transported further typically command higher prices
- **Player Impact**: High trading volume in a sector temporarily affects values
