REVIEW GUIDE: _REVIEW_NEEDED/README.md
==========================================

ISSUE: This README is OUTDATED and INACCURATE

The README claims there are 50+ files including:
- audits-summaries/ directory (DOES NOT EXIST)
- development-plans/ directory (DOES NOT EXIST)
- 30+ files in status-tracking/ (ONLY 5 files exist)

ACTUAL CONTENTS (as of 2025-12-09):
- README.md (this file - needs update or deletion)
- status-tracking/README.md
- status-tracking/combat-interface/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md
- status-tracking/ship-management/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md
- status-tracking/team-systems/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md
- status-tracking/trading-system/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md

DECISION NEEDED:

Option A: DELETE this README entirely
  - The instructions reference non-existent directories
  - The file counts are wrong
  - A simpler README could be created if needed

Option B: UPDATE this README to reflect reality
  - Remove references to non-existent directories
  - Update to show only the 4 COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION files
  - Simplify the review strategy section

Option C: KEEP as-is if the missing directories will be restored
  - Were these directories moved elsewhere?
  - Should they be restored from git history?

MY RECOMMENDATION: Option A (delete) - the file is more confusing than helpful
