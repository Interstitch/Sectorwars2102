REVIEW GUIDE: combat-interface/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md
=========================================================

SUMMARY: Comprehensive combat system specification (288 lines)

CONTENT OVERVIEW:
- Combat initiation types (ambush, mutual, pursuit, defense)
- Combat HUD layout with ASCII mockups
- Turn-based combat mechanics (planning, execution, resolution)
- Weapon systems (energy, projectile, special)
- Damage calculation formulas
- Visual effects and camera system
- AI behavior patterns (aggressive, defensive, tactical)
- Combat rewards and loot system
- Mobile touch controls adaptation
- Multiplayer/PvP mechanics
- Implementation timeline (Week 5-6 estimates)

QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
+ Well-structured with TypeScript interfaces
+ Clear UI mockups in ASCII art
+ Covers mobile considerations
+ Has success metrics defined
+ Includes damage calculation formulas

CONCERNS:
- References "Week 5-6" timeline from old planning cycle
- May overlap with existing DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/COMBAT_MECHANICS.md
- No date stamp - unclear when this was written

DECISION NEEDED:

Option A: MERGE into DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/COMBAT_MECHANICS.md
  - Check for duplicate content
  - Add any unique TypeScript interfaces
  - Consolidate into single authoritative source

Option B: MOVE to DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/COMBAT_INTERFACE_SPEC.md
  - Keep as separate detailed implementation spec
  - Reference from COMBAT_MECHANICS.md

Option C: DELETE as redundant
  - If COMBAT_MECHANICS.md already covers this
  - Or if combat system is already implemented differently

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Compare with DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/COMBAT_MECHANICS.md
2. Check if TypeScript interfaces match actual implementation
3. Verify if combat system in codebase follows this spec

MY RECOMMENDATION: Compare with COMBAT_MECHANICS.md - likely should merge
the TypeScript interfaces and delete the rest as potentially outdated
