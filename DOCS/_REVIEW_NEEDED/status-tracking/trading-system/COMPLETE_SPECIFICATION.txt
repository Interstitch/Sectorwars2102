REVIEW GUIDE: trading-system/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md
=======================================================

SUMMARY: Trading system specification (264 lines)

CONTENT OVERVIEW:
- Port Trading Interface (UI requirements, user flow)
- Commodity System (4 tiers from basic to rare)
- Price Calculation (supply/demand/tech/events formula)
- Supply & Demand Mechanics (dynamic market, arbitrage)
- Port Specialization (agricultural, industrial, tech, luxury)
- Trading Routes (route planning, automated trading)
- Advanced Features (contracts, market manipulation, black market)
- UI/UX Design (desktop and mobile layouts)
- Integration Points (API endpoints, WebSocket updates)
- Balancing Parameters (config values)
- Implementation priorities (core, market dynamics, advanced)
- Success metrics

QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
+ Clear price calculation formula
+ Well-defined commodity tiers
+ Port specialization creates gameplay depth
+ API endpoint list included
+ Balancing parameters documented
+ Success metrics defined

KEY MECHANICS DOCUMENTED:
- Price formula: base * supply * demand * tech * events
- 2% transaction fee
- 5% bulk discount
- 10% reputation bonus
- Market rebalances 10% per hour

CONCERNS:
- No timestamp - unclear when written
- May overlap with DOCS/FEATURES/ECONOMY/PORT_TRADING.md
- Black market system - is this implemented?
- Contract system - is this implemented?

DECISION NEEDED:

Option A: MERGE into DOCS/FEATURES/ECONOMY/PORT_TRADING.md
  - Add price formulas and TypeScript interfaces
  - Consolidate all trading docs

Option B: MOVE to DOCS/FEATURES/ECONOMY/TRADING_SPEC.md
  - Keep as detailed implementation reference
  - PORT_TRADING.md for high-level concepts

Option C: EXTRACT useful parts only
  - Price formulas -> PORT_TRADING.md
  - API endpoints -> verify against actual code
  - Delete rest if redundant

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Compare with DOCS/FEATURES/ECONOMY/PORT_TRADING.md
2. Check gameserver trading routes for actual API
3. Verify price calculation in trading service
4. Check if commodities match RESOURCE_TYPES.md

MY RECOMMENDATION: This has VALUABLE implementation details (formulas,
config values). Merge into PORT_TRADING.md or keep alongside it as
implementation spec. Do NOT delete without extracting the formulas.
