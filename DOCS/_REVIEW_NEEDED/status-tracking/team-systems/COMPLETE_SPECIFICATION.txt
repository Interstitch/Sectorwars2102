REVIEW GUIDE: team-systems/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md
=====================================================

SUMMARY: Team/guild system specification (368 lines)

CONTENT OVERVIEW:
- Team Structure (guild, corporation, militia, alliance types)
- Team Creation (founding fee, customization, emblem design)
- Membership System (roles: founder, officer, veteran, member, recruit)
- Team Communication (chat channels, coordination tools)
- Economic Systems (treasury, taxes, shared resources)
- Territory Control (sector control, influence, structures)
- Team Warfare (war declaration, scoring, objectives)
- Alliance System (multi-team alliances, council voting)
- Team Progression (levels, unlocks, perks)
- Mobile UI considerations
- Implementation timeline (Week 7-8)
- Social features (events, leaderboards)

QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
+ Comprehensive coverage of team mechanics
+ Well-defined TypeScript interfaces
+ Clear permission matrix system
+ Territory control mechanics detailed
+ War system with scoring
+ Member capacity limit (6) for balance

NOTABLE DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Team size limited to 6 members (prevents power concentration)
- 50,000 credit founding fee
- Tax system on member earnings
- Democracy voting option
- Territory benefits (tax revenue, trade bonuses)

CONCERNS:
- Week 7-8 timeline from old planning cycle
- May overlap with DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/TEAM_SYSTEMS.md
- Member limit of 6 seems very small - intentional?
- Alliance system quite complex

DECISION NEEDED:

Option A: MERGE into DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/TEAM_SYSTEMS.md
  - Existing file may be less detailed
  - Add TypeScript interfaces and UI mockups

Option B: REPLACE existing TEAM_SYSTEMS.md with this spec
  - If this is more comprehensive
  - Update to remove timeline references

Option C: KEEP BOTH if they serve different purposes
  - TEAM_SYSTEMS.md for high-level concepts
  - This spec for implementation details

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Compare with DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/TEAM_SYSTEMS.md
2. Check if team system is implemented in gameserver
3. Verify member limits and treasury in database schema
4. Check if territory control exists

MY RECOMMENDATION: Compare with existing TEAM_SYSTEMS.md - this appears
more detailed and should likely replace or be merged with existing doc
