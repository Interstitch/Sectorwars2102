REVIEW GUIDE: ship-management/COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md
=========================================================

SUMMARY: Ship management system specification (327 lines)

CONTENT OVERVIEW:
- Ship Dashboard (status, location, systems)
- Navigation System (movement, pathfinding, autopilot)
- Cargo Management (inventory, capacity, actions)
- Ship Upgrades (propulsion, combat, utility, special)
- Maintenance System (wear/tear, repair costs, failure risks)
- Combat Interface (weapons, tactics, HUD)
- Fleet Management (multi-ship control - marked "Future")
- Emergency Systems (escape pods, insurance)
- API endpoints specification
- Real-time update requirements
- Mobile touch controls
- Performance requirements
- Implementation timeline (Week 3-4)

QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
+ Very detailed TypeScript interfaces
+ Clear ASCII UI mockups
+ Covers maintenance/degradation mechanics
+ Includes API endpoint list
+ Has performance requirements (60fps, <100ms)
+ Mobile considerations included

CONCERNS:
- Week 3-4 timeline references old planning cycle
- May overlap with existing DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/SHIP_MAINTENANCE.md
- "Fleet Management (Future)" - is this still planned?
- Insurance system - is this implemented?

DECISION NEEDED:

Option A: MERGE into existing ship-related docs
  - DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/SHIP_MAINTENANCE.md (maintenance parts)
  - DOCS/FEATURES/DEFINITIONS/SHIP_TYPES.md (upgrade parts)
  - Create new SHIP_DASHBOARD.md for UI specs

Option B: MOVE to DOCS/FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/SHIP_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md
  - Keep as comprehensive implementation reference
  - Update to remove outdated timeline references

Option C: ARCHIVE as historical planning document
  - If implementation diverged from this spec
  - Keep for reference but mark as historical

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Check player-client for existing ship management UI
2. Compare API endpoints with actual gameserver routes
3. Verify if maintenance/degradation system exists
4. Check if cargo management matches this spec

MY RECOMMENDATION: This is HIGH VALUE content - move to FEATURES/GAMEPLAY/
after verifying against implementation, remove timeline references
