# Advanced Team Systems

## Overview

The Trade Wars 2002 Team Systems module delivers a revolutionary alliance infrastructure that transcends simple grouping to create deep, strategic relationships between players. Our sophisticated implementation transforms solo gameplay into coordinated fleet operations, enabling resource sharing, tactical combat advantages, and secure team communications.

## Technical Highlights

### Distributed Team Architecture

Our team foundation leverages advanced distributed design principles:

* **Federated Team Structure**: Up to 4-member teams with unique identifiers
* **Password-Protected Membership**: Secure team access with cryptographic verification
* **Cross-Instance Persistence**: Team data maintained across server deployments
* **Hierarchical Data Model**: Sophisticated relationship mapping between players and teams

```javascript
// Team data model showcasing our sophisticated structure
const teamSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  teamId: { 
    type: Number, 
    required: true, 
    unique: true,
    index: true 
  },
  name: { 
    type: String, 
    default: function() { return `Team ${this.teamId}`; } 
  },
  password: { 
    type: String, 
    required: true,
    select: false, // Security: password not included in queries by default
  },
  members: [{ 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'User',
    index: true 
  }],
  created: { 
    type: Date, 
    default: Date.now 
  },
  lastActive: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  // Additional team metadata
  stats: {
    totalCredits: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    totalFighters: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    totalPlanets: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    combatVictories: { type: Number, default: 0 }
  }
});
```

### Secure Resource Sharing Engine

Our resource distribution system enables sophisticated economic cooperation:

* **Real-Time Credit Transfer**: Instantaneous financial transactions between members
* **Fighter Redistribution Protocol**: Strategic reallocation of combat resources
* **Location-Aware Transfers**: Proximity validation for realistic resource movement
* **Transaction Integrity Protection**: Atomic operations prevent duplication or loss

```javascript
// Team resource transfer showcasing our transaction integrity system
async function transferResources(fromUser, toUser, resourceType, amount) {
  // Start database transaction for atomic operation
  const session = await mongoose.startSession();
  session.startTransaction();
  
  try {
    // Validate team membership
    if (fromUser.teamNumber !== toUser.teamNumber || fromUser.teamNumber === 0) {
      throw new Error("Team transfer requires both users in same team");
    }
    
    // Validate physical proximity
    if (fromUser.sector !== toUser.sector) {
      throw new Error("Must be in same sector for resource transfer");
    }
    
    // Apply transfer based on resource type
    switch(resourceType) {
      case 'credits':
        // Validate limits and balances
        if (amount <= 0 || amount > 25000) {
          throw new Error("Credit transfer limited to 1-25,000 units");
        }
        if (fromUser.credits < amount) {
          throw new Error("Insufficient credits for transfer");
        }
        
        // Update both users atomically
        await User.findByIdAndUpdate(
          fromUser._id, 
          { $inc: { credits: -amount } }, 
          { session }
        );
        
        await User.findByIdAndUpdate(
          toUser._id, 
          { $inc: { credits: amount } }, 
          { session }
        );
        break;
      
      case 'fighters':
        // Similar validation and transfer logic
        // ...
        break;
    }
    
    // Log the transaction
    await TeamTransaction.create([{
      fromUser: fromUser._id,
      toUser: toUser._id,
      teamId: fromUser.teamNumber,
      resourceType,
      amount,
      timestamp: new Date()
    }], { session });
    
    // Commit the transaction
    await session.commitTransaction();
    
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback on any error
    await session.abortTransaction();
    throw error;
  } finally {
    session.endSession();
  }
}
```
