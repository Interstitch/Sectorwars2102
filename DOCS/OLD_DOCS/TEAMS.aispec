# Team System Implementation Guide

This document outlines the implementation details for the team system in Trade Wars 2002.

## Overview

The team system allows players to form cooperative alliances, share resources, and coordinate strategic actions. Teams enhance gameplay by enabling collaborative strategies while maintaining individual player progression and competition between different teams.

## Team Data Model

The team system uses relationships between user records rather than a separate team entity. Each user has a teamNumber property that identifies their team membership. Team numbers 1-9 represent valid teams, while 0 indicates no team membership.

Key team-related user properties include:
- teamNumber: Identifies team membership (0 = no team)
- teamJoinDate: When the player joined their current team
- teamRole: Player's role within the team (leader, member)

## Team Formation

### Creating a Team

Team creation requires:
- Player must not be in an existing team
- Payment of a significant credit fee (10,000 credits)
- Selection of an available team number (1-9)
- Automatic assignment as team leader

### Joining a Team

Players can join existing teams through:
- Invitation from a team leader
- Both players must be in the same sector
- Limited to a maximum of 8 players per team
- Cooldown period between team changes (24 hours)

## Team Benefits

### Resource Sharing

Team members can share resources including:
- Credits (currency transfers)
- Fighters (combat units)
- Commodities (trading goods)

These transfers have restrictions:
- Must occur while in the same sector
- Maximum transfer limits
- Only between active team members

### Combat Advantages

Teams gain advantages in combat scenarios:
- Coordination of fighter deployments
- Shared fighter control in sectors
- Combat bonuses against non-team players
- Protection from friendly fire

### Communication

Team members have access to:
- Private team chat channel
- Team member location awareness
- Automated notifications for significant events
- Strategic planning interfaces

## Team Management

### Leader Responsibilities

Team leaders can:
- Invite new members
- Remove existing members
- Set member permissions
- Dissolve the team completely

### Member Management

The team system includes features for:
- Viewing team member status
- Tracking contributions
- Setting team objectives
- Coordinating strategic moves

## Team Limitations

To maintain game balance, teams have limitations:
- Maximum of 8 players per team
- Restricted resource sharing in protected sectors
- No shared ownership of planets
- Team members still compete individually for ranking

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing the team system:
- Ensure database transactions for resource transfers
- Implement proper validation for all team operations
- Provide clear visual indicators of team membership
- Balance team advantages with solo player viability

## Testing Guidelines

Testing of the team system should cover:
- Team formation and dissolution
- Resource sharing mechanics
- Combat coordination scenarios
- Edge cases like player disconnection during transfers
- Proper application of team benefits and limitations
