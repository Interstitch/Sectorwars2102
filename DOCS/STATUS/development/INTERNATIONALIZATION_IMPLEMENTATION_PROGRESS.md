## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core translation tables created:

- translation_namespaces (8 organized namespaces)
- translation_keys (key-value pairs with metadata)
- user_language_preferences (user-specific settings)
- translation_progress (completion tracking)
- translation_audit_logs (change history)
```

### API Endpoints Implemented
```
GET    /api/v1/i18n/languages          # List supported languages
GET    /api/v1/i18n/detect             # Auto-detect language
GET    /api/v1/i18n/{lang}             # Get all translations
GET    /api/v1/i18n/{lang}/{namespace} # Get namespace translations
