## Technical Approach

### Architecture
```
player-client/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ trading/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ships/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ combat/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ galaxy/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ teams/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gameAPI.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ websocket.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ state.ts
â””â”€â”€ contexts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ GameContext.tsx
    â””â”€â”€ PlayerContext.tsx
```

### State Management
- Use React Context for game state
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Local storage for preferences

### Design System Integration
- Follow design tokens from design-system/
- Ensure component reusability
- Mobile-first approach

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: Players can trade, travel, and engage in combat
2. **Performance**: 60fps UI, <100ms API responses
3. **Intuitive**: New players understand within 5 minutes
4. **Engaging**: Players want to continue playing
5. **Stable**: No critical bugs in core loop

## Daily Tracking

Progress will be tracked in subdirectories:
- `week-1-trading-interface/`
- `week-2-trading-integration/`
- etc.

Each week will have:
- Daily standup notes
- Completed features
- Blockers/issues
- Next day plan
