- **Colony Guidance**: "Which planet should I terraform next for maximum profit?"
- **Port Management**: "Should I buy that port in Sector 15? What's the ROI?"

#### 1.2 Natural Language Processing Enhancement
**Build on existing chat interface**:

```typescript
// Extend existing AIAssistant component
interface EnhancedAICapabilities {
  trading: "What's the best trade route?" // EXISTING
  exploration: "Find me unexplored sectors with valuable resources"
  combat: "Analyze this battle formation and suggest improvements"
  colonization: "Help me plan my next terraforming project"
  port_management: "Show me profitable ports for sale"
  team_coordination: "What should our team focus on this week?"
}
```
