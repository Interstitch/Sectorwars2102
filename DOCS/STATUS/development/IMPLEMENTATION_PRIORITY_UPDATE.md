## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE CHANGES

### **Database Architecture**
```sql
-- New optimized battle state storage
CREATE TABLE large_battle_states (
    battle_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    turn_number INTEGER,
    compressed_state BYTEA,
    state_hash CHAR(64),
    participant_count INTEGER,
    processing_time_ms INTEGER
);

-- Partitioned by battle size for optimal performance
CREATE INDEX idx_battles_by_size ON large_battle_states (participant_count);
```

### **Caching Strategy**
```typescript
interface CombatCaching {
  battle_states: "30 second TTL, 10GB Redis cluster";
  unit_templates: "1 hour TTL, preload common types";
  combat_calculations: "5 minute TTL, cache damage formulas";
  predictive_caching: "Pre-calculate likely next turn states";
}
```

### **Real-time Architecture**
```typescript
interface RealTimeSystem {
  websocket_tiers: {
    gold: "Instant updates, full data";
    silver: "1-second batched updates";
    bronze: "3-second batched updates";
    spectator: "5-second summary updates";
  };
  compression: "Delta updates + spatial culling";
  scaling: "Auto-scale based on active battles";
}
```
