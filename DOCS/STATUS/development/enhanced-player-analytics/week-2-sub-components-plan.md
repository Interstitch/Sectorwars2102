## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

### Component Layout
```
PlayerAnalytics (Main)
├── PlayerDetailEditor (Modal)
│   ├── Basic Info Section
│   ├── Game Stats Section
│   ├── ARIA AI Section
│   └── Asset Summary
├── PlayerAssetManager (Modal)
│   ├── Ships Tab
│   ├── Planets Tab
│   ├── Ports Tab
│   └── Inventory Tab
├── BulkOperationPanel (Slide-out Panel)
│   ├── Operation Selector
│   ├── Parameter Config
│   └── Preview & Execute
├── EmergencyOperationsPanel (Modal)
│   ├── Quick Actions
│   ├── Advanced Options
│   └── Operation Log
└── InterventionPanel (Dedicated View)
    ├── Request Queue
    ├── Active Interventions
    └── History
```

### Design Patterns
- Consistent modal styling
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### State Management
- Extend PlayerAnalyticsState interface
- Add sub-component visibility flags
- Implement operation result handling
- Manage loading states per component

### API Integration Preparation
```typescript
// Prepared endpoints (to be implemented in Week 3)
POST   /api/v1/admin/players/bulk-operations
POST   /api/v1/admin/players/{id}/assets/transfer
POST   /api/v1/admin/players/{id}/emergency/{action}
GET    /api/v1/admin/players/{id}/assets/detailed
POST   /api/v1/admin/interventions
GET    /api/v1/admin/interventions/queue
```

### Type Definitions
```typescript
interface BulkOperation {
  type: 'credits' | 'turns' | 'status' | 'team' | 'message';
  action: 'add' | 'remove' | 'set';
  value: any;
  playerIds: string[];
  reason: string;
}

interface AssetTransfer {
  assetType: 'ship' | 'planet' | 'port' | 'item';
  assetId: string;
  fromPlayerId: string;
  toPlayerId: string;
  reason: string;
}

interface EmergencyAction {
  type: 'teleport' | 'rescue' | 'economic' | 'combat' | 'account';
  action: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  playerId: string;
  adminNotes: string;
}
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Each Component Must:
1. Pass TypeScript compilation with no errors
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Provide loading states for all async operations
4. Include confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
5. Log all admin actions for audit trail
6. Be fully responsive (mobile-friendly)
7. Include keyboard navigation support
8. Follow established design patterns

### Integration Requirements:
1. Components integrate seamlessly with PlayerAnalytics
2. State updates propagate correctly
3. No memory leaks or performance issues
4. Proper cleanup on component unmount

## 📊 Success Metrics

- All 5 components implemented and integrated
- Zero TypeScript errors
- All components responsive on mobile
- Loading time < 200ms per component
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Comprehensive error handling coverage

## 🚀 Next Phase Preview

After Week 2 completion, Week 3 will focus on:
