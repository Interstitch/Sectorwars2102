# Multi-Regional Restructuring - Master Implementation Plan

*Created: June 1, 2025*  
*Status: NOT STARTED*  
*Timeline: 24 weeks (6 months)*  
*Scope: Transform single-galaxy game into multi-regional galaxy platform*

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This implementation plan transforms SectorWars 2102 from a single 500-sector galaxy into a **Multi-Regional Galaxy Platform** with:
- **Central Nexus**: Massive 2000-5000 sector hub galaxy
- **Regional Instances**: 500-sector regions owned by entrepreneurial players
- **Inter-Regional Travel**: Quantum warp tunnel connections between regions
- **Tiered Subscriptions**: Free regional residents and $5/month Galactic Citizens
- **Regional Ownership**: $25/month to own and operate a region
