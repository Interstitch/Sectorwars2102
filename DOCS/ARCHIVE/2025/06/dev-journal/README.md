# Development Journal

This directory contains development journal entries documenting the evolution of the project. Each entry captures key decisions, challenges, solutions, and learnings throughout the development process.

## Purpose

- Track the thought process behind architectural and design decisions
- Document challenges encountered and their solutions
- Create a knowledge base for future reference
- Provide context for code changes over time

## Journal Structure

Entries are organized chronologically with the following naming convention:

`YYYY-MM-DD_N_topic.md`

Where `N` is a sequence number for multiple entries on the same day.

For example:
- `2023-05-10_1_project_initialization.md`
- `2023-05-10_2_database_setup.md`
- `2023-05-15_1_user_authentication.md`

## Entry Format

Each journal entry follows this format:

```markdown
# Date: YYYY-MM-DD_N
# Topic: Brief Description

## Context
Brief explanation of the current state and why this work was needed

## Decisions
Key decisions made and reasoning behind them

## Implementation
Details of how the solution was implemented

## Challenges
Issues encountered during the process

## Solutions
How challenges were overcome

## Lessons
What was learned from this experience

## Next Steps
Planned follow-up actions
```

## Usage Guidelines

- Create a new entry for significant development activities
- For multiple entries on the same day, increment the sequence number
- Focus on explaining "why" rather than just "what" or "how"
- Include code snippets or links to relevant files when helpful
- Update entries if new information becomes available
