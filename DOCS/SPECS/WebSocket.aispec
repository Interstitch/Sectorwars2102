OVERVIEW: Real-time WebSocket infrastructure for SectorWars 2102 supporting player gameplay, admin monitoring, team communication, and live game events with automatic reconnection and sector-based broadcasting.

FACTS:
* Protocol: Raw WebSocket (not Socket.IO) for performance and consistency
* Authentication: JWT token via query parameter (?token={jwt})
* Dual connections: Separate player and admin WebSocket endpoints
* Connection management: Automatic cleanup, heartbeat monitoring, exponential backoff
* Broadcasting: Sector-based, team-based, and global message routing
* Event types: 15+ event types for gameplay, admin, and system notifications
* Security: Token-based authentication with role separation
* Scalability: Connection manager supports thousands of concurrent connections
* Reliability: Automatic reconnection with connection health monitoring

PLAYER_WEBSOCKET:
* Endpoint: WS /ws/connect?token={jwt}
* Purpose: Real-time gameplay events and communication
* Authentication: Player JWT token required
* Events received: player_entered_sector, player_left_sector, chat_message, combat_update, market_update, heartbeat_ack
* Events sent: chat_message, heartbeat, sector_query, team_message
* Auto-reconnect: 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff
* Heartbeat: 30-second interval with timeout detection

ADMIN_WEBSOCKET:
* Endpoint: WS /ws/admin?token={jwt}
* Purpose: Administrative monitoring and control
* Authentication: Admin JWT token required
* Events received: connection:established, system:stats, economy:alert, combat:new-event, system:announcement
* Events sent: heartbeat, broadcast_request, stats_request, admin_intervention
* Features: Global broadcasting, system monitoring, real-time admin dashboard updates
* Statistics: Connection counts, sector populations, system health metrics

EVENT_TYPES:
* heartbeat - Connection health check (bidirectional)
* heartbeat_ack - Heartbeat acknowledgment from server
* player_entered_sector - Player movement notification
* player_left_sector - Player departure notification  
* chat_message - Chat communication (global, team, sector)
* combat_update - Real-time combat events and results
* market_update - Trading and economy changes
* connection:established - Initial connection confirmation
* system:stats - Real-time system statistics
* economy:alert - Economic system alerts and warnings
* combat:new-event - New combat encounters
* system:announcement - Server-wide announcements
* team_message - Team-specific communication
* sector_query - Request sector player information
* admin_intervention - Administrative actions

MESSAGE_SCHEMA:
```json
{
  "type": "event_type",
  "data": {
    "timestamp": "ISO8601",
    "payload": "event_specific_data"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "sender_id": "optional",
    "target": "sector|team|global",
    "priority": "normal|high|urgent"
  }
}
```

PLAYER_EVENTS:
* chat_message: {type: "chat_message", content: "text", target_type: "global|team|sector", target_id: "optional"}
* heartbeat: {type: "heartbeat", timestamp: "ISO8601"}
* sector_query: {type: "sector_query", sector_id: "uuid"}
* team_message: {type: "team_message", content: "text", team_id: "uuid"}

ADMIN_EVENTS:
* broadcast_request: {type: "broadcast", message: "text", target: "all|sector|team", target_id: "optional"}
* stats_request: {type: "stats_request"}
* admin_intervention: {type: "intervention", action: "string", target_id: "uuid", params: {}}

CONNECTION_LIFECYCLE:
* Connect: WebSocket handshake with JWT validation
* Authenticate: Token verification and role assignment
* Register: Connection added to appropriate manager (player/admin)
* Heartbeat: Regular ping/pong for connection health
* Event handling: Message routing based on type and target
* Disconnect: Automatic cleanup and notification
* Reconnect: Exponential backoff retry mechanism

BROADCASTING_MODES:
* Global: All connected players receive message
* Sector: Only players in specific sector receive message
* Team: Only team members receive message
* Admin: Only admin connections receive message
* Direct: Point-to-point message to specific user

SECURITY_FEATURES:
* JWT token validation on connection
* Role-based message filtering (admin vs player)
* Rate limiting on message sending
* Connection source tracking
* Audit logging for admin actions
* Automatic disconnection on token expiry

PERFORMANCE_CHARACTERISTICS:
* Connection overhead: ~2KB per connection
* Message latency: <50ms local, <200ms cross-region  
* Throughput: 1000+ messages/second per server
* Concurrent connections: 5000+ supported
* Memory usage: ~1MB per 1000 connections
* CPU usage: <5% for typical game load

INTEGRATION_POINTS:
* Player movement: Automatic sector notifications
* Combat system: Real-time battle updates
* Trading: Market price change notifications
* Team system: Team chat and coordination
* Admin dashboard: Live system monitoring
* Economy: Price alerts and market events

RELIABILITY_FEATURES:
* Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
* Message queuing during disconnection
* Duplicate message detection and filtering
* Connection health monitoring
* Graceful degradation on server overload
* Failover support for high availability

ERROR_HANDLING:
* Connection timeout: 60 seconds
* Reconnection attempts: 5 with backoff
* Invalid token: Immediate disconnection
* Rate limit exceeded: Temporary message blocking
* Server overload: Queue messages with timeout
* Network issues: Automatic retry with exponential delay

EXAMPLES:
```javascript
// Player connection
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/connect?token=jwt_token');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (msg.type === 'player_entered_sector') {
    console.log('Player entered:', msg.data.player_name);
  }
};

// Send chat message
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'chat_message',
  content: 'Hello everyone!',
  target_type: 'global'
}));

// Admin connection
const adminWs = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/admin?token=admin_jwt');
adminWs.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'broadcast',
  message: 'Server maintenance in 5 minutes',
  target: 'all'
}));
