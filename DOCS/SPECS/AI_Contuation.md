This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:

Analysis:
I need to chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all technical details, user requests, and my implementation work. Let me go through each section:

1. **Initial Context**: [Describe how the conversation started, what summary or context was provided from previous sessions, and the overall setup]

2. **Previous Work Completed**: [Detail all work that had been completed before the current session, including major implementations and achievements]

3. **Current Task Continuation**: [Explain what task was being continued and what the user requested to continue with]

4. **[Specific Implementation Sections]**: [Add sections for each major implementation or task worked on, such as "Docker Architecture Implementation", "Central Nexus Generation", etc., with detailed technical descriptions]

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
[Describe the main user request and overall goal of the conversation, including specific technical requirements and expected outcomes.]

2. Key Technical Concepts:
[List all technologies, frameworks, methodologies, architectural patterns, and technical approaches mentioned or used throughout the conversation.]

3. Files and Code Sections:
[List all files created, modified, or referenced with their full paths. Include key code snippets with explanations and highlight important functions/methods with brief descriptions using proper code formatting.]

4. Problem Solving:
[Describe issues encountered and how they were resolved, technical challenges and solutions implemented, and design decisions with their rationales.]

5. Pending Tasks:
[List remaining work items with their priority levels, next steps in the development process, and any blocked or deferred items.]

6. Current Work:
[Describe what was being worked on most recently, current implementation status, and the last completed milestone or feature.]

7. Optional Next Step:
[Suggest the logical next action to take, recommended continuation path, and context for why this should be the next focus.]

Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
