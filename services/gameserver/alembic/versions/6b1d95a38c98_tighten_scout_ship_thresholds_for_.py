    """
    Tighten ship persuasion thresholds to account for new consistency-weighted scoring (50%).

    With consistency now at 50% weight (up from 20%), the scoring formula has changed from:
      OLD: (persuasiveness * 0.5) + (confidence * 0.3) + (consistency * 0.2)
      NEW: (consistency * 0.5) + (confidence * 0.3) + (persuasiveness * 0.2)

    This makes lying/contradictions MUCH more punishing, so we need tighter thresholds
    to maintain game balance and ensure interrogation difficulty is realistic.

    Samantha's Recommendation: Scout Ship is a valuable asset worth 500k+ credits.
    Guards should be VERY skeptical of someone claiming ownership without perfect consistency.
