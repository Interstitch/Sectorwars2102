# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# SectorWars 2102 Development Environment
# 
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access.

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only

# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.

# SECURITY NOTES:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. The above configuration is designed for development environments
# 2. For production, restrict the ADDRESS field to specific IP ranges
# 3. Consider using 'scram-sha-256' instead of 'md5' for better security
# 4. Remove the 0.0.0.0/0 rule in production environments
# 5. Use SSL/TLS for connections in production (hostssl instead of host)
