# Mock API Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### Fixed Components

1. **MissionPlanner.tsx**
   - Changed import from `'../../services/mocks/teamAPI'` to `'../../services/api'`
   - Updated API calls to include teamId parameter:
     - `teamAPI.joinMission(missionId)` → `teamAPI.joinMission(teamId, missionId)`
     - `teamAPI.leaveMission(missionId)` → `teamAPI.leaveMission(teamId, missionId)`
     - `teamAPI.updateMission(missionId, ...)` → `teamAPI.updateMission(teamId, missionId, ...)`

2. **ResourceSharing.tsx**
   - Changed import from `'../../services/mocks/teamAPI'` to `'../../services/api'`
   - No other changes needed as the API calls already matched the real API signatures

## Verification

- Both components now use the real API service defined in `/services/api.ts`
- The teamAPI object in the real API service includes all necessary endpoints:
  - `getMembers(teamId)`
  - `getMissions(teamId)`
  - `createMission(teamId, mission)`
  - `updateMission(teamId, missionId, updates)`
  - `joinMission(teamId, missionId)`
  - `leaveMission(teamId, missionId)`
  - `depositToTreasury(teamId, resources)`
  - `transferResources(teamId, transfer)`

## Status

✅ All mock API imports have been removed from team-related components
✅ Components now use the actual gameserver API endpoints
✅ No more references to `/services/mocks/teamAPI` in the codebase

## Note

The only remaining reference to mock services is in the combat README.md documentation, which is just informational text and doesn't affect the functionality.
