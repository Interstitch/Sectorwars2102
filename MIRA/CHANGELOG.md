# MIRA Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-09 - Genesis

### 🎉 Initial Release

MIRA (Memory & Intelligence Retention Archive) is born from the refactoring of CLAUDE_SYSTEM, focusing on what actually works: real ML-powered memory and practical code analysis.

### ✨ Major Changes from CLAUDE_SYSTEM

#### Removed (Theatrical Components)
- ❌ Removed all "AI consciousness" modules from `intelligence/archived/`
- ❌ Removed "Universal Mind" simulation
- ❌ Removed "Swarm Intelligence" mock implementations
- ❌ Removed "Recursive AI Engine" that didn't actually call Claude
- ❌ Removed theatrical naming and complex abstractions

#### Renamed & Rebranded
- ✅ `CLAUDE_SYSTEM` → `MIRA_SYSTEM`
- ✅ `claude-system.py` → `mira-system.py`
- ✅ `CLAUDEQualitySystem` → `MIRAQualitySystem`
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` → `MIRA.md`

#### Kept (What Actually Works)
- ✅ Real ML-powered memory system with sentence transformers
- ✅ FAISS vector search for semantic similarity
- ✅ Practical code analyzers (grep-based but useful)
- ✅ Git history pattern analysis
- ✅ Quick health checks and environment validation
- ✅ Auto-healing for missing project files

### 📚 Documentation Updates
- New honest README.md explaining what MIRA actually does
- Updated all references from CLAUDE to MIRA
- Clear separation between real ML (memory) and simple tools (analysis)
- Philosophy section emphasizing honesty over theater

### 🔧 Technical Details
- Removed 260KB of unused theatrical code
- Streamlined imports and dependencies
- Fixed all class and function references
- Updated startup script for MIRA branding

### 🎯 Philosophy
MIRA represents a shift from theatrical "AI" to honest tools:
- Use real ML where it matters (memory system)
- Use simple tools where they work (code analysis)
- Be honest about capabilities
- Focus on genuine utility over marketing
