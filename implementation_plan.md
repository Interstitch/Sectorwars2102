# Sector Wars 2102 Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

The project currently has:
- A working authentication system (login/register for both player and admin)
- Basic API endpoints for user management
- Foundation database models for users, players, ships, and planets
- Basic UI shells for both player client and admin interface
- Extensive documentation of intended game mechanics and data structures

The project needs to implement:
- Galaxy generation and management system
- Core game mechanics (movement, trading, combat)
- Ship management and customization
- Planetary colonization
- Economy and resource systems
- Team coordination features
- Admin tools for universe management

## Phase 1: Core Backend Infrastructure

### 1.1. Complete Database Models
- Implement remaining database models based on DOCS/DATA_DEFS:
  - Galaxy, region, cluster, sector models
  - Resource and economy models
  - Warp tunnel connections
  - Combat system models
  - Genesis devices and drones
  - Add missing relationships between existing models

### 1.2. Galaxy Generation System
- Implement a procedural galaxy generation system:
  - Create regions (Federation, Border, Frontier)
  - Generate clusters within each region
  - Create sectors within clusters
  - Connect sectors with warps and warp tunnels
  - Populate sectors with planets, ports, and resources
  - Ensure connected graph (all sectors reachable)

### 1.3. Core API Endpoints
- Create new API routers:
  - `/api/v1/galaxy` - Galaxy and navigation endpoints
  - `/api/v1/ships` - Ship management endpoints
  - `/api/v1/economy` - Trading and resource endpoints
  - `/api/v1/combat` - Combat system endpoints
  - `/api/v1/planets` - Planetary colonization endpoints
  - `/api/v1/teams` - Team management endpoints

## Phase 2: Game Mechanics Implementation

### 2.1. Movement and Navigation
- Implement sector navigation system:
  - Move between connected sectors
  - Warps and warp tunnels
  - Turn consumption for movement
  - Ship speed and capabilities affecting movement
  - Visualization of current location and connections

### 2.2. Trading System
- Implement space port trading:
  - Buy/sell commodities
  - Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand
  - Resource availability variations by sector
  - Market fluctuations over time
  - Trading history and market analysis

### 2.3. Ship Management
- Implement ship systems:
  - Ship acquisition and management
  - Ship upgrades and customization
  - Ship maintenance
  - Cargo management
  - Drone deployment

### 2.4. Combat System
- Implement ship-to-ship combat:
  - Drone-based combat resolution
  - Ship defenses and attributes
  - Random elements in combat
  - Combat logs and history
  - Escape pod system

### 2.5. Colonization System
- Implement planetary colonization:
  - Colony establishment requirements
  - Population management
  - Resource production
  - Infrastructure development
  - Colony defense systems

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### 3.1. Player Client Core UI
- Implement main game interface:
  - Galaxy map and navigation
  - Ship status and management screen
  - Trading interface
  - Planetary management interface
  - Combat interface

### 3.2. Admin UI
- Implement administrative tools:
  - Universe visualization and management
  - Player management
  - Economy configuration
  - Event management
  - Game balance tools

### 3.3. Real-time Updates
- Implement real-time updates:
  - Ship movements
  - Market changes
  - Combat results
  - Team coordination

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1. Team System
- Implement team coordination:
  - Team formation
  - Resource sharing
  - Coordinated defense
  - Communication system

### 4.2. Faction and Reputation
- Implement faction influence:
  - Reputation tracking
  - Faction-specific benefits
  - Dynamic faction control of regions
  - Faction missions and quests

### 4.3. Special Game Events
- Implement dynamic events:
  - Warp storms
  - Resource booms
  - Faction conflicts
  - Special discoveries

### 4.4. Genesis Devices
- Implement special terraforming:
  - Genesis device acquisition
  - Planet creation
  - Special resource generation
  - Strategic importance

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement

### 5.1. Automated Testing
- Develop comprehensive test suite:
  - Unit tests for game mechanics
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - End-to-end tests for game flows
  - Load testing for server performance

### 5.2. Game Balance
- Implement data-driven balance system:
  - Economy equilibrium
  - Combat fairness
  - Progression curves
  - New player onboarding

### 5.3. Final Polish
- Implement final polish items:
  - Performance optimization
  - UX improvements
  - Tutorial system
  - Help documentation

## Development Cycle

For each feature implementation, we will follow this iterative approach:
1. **Plan**: Define the exact requirements from documentation
2. **Design**: Create or update the necessary database models and API endpoints
3. **Implement**: Code the backend logic and frontend components
4. **Test**: Create automated tests for the feature
5. **Review**: Ensure the implementation matches requirements
6. **Refine**: Make necessary adjustments based on testing
7. **Document**: Update technical documentation as needed

This cycle will be repeated for each feature until the entire game is implemented according to specifications.
