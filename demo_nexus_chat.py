🌟 NEXUS Chat Demo - Real-time Claude Code Interface
====================================================

This demonstrates how NEXUS Chat works:

1. Background Initialization:
🚀 Initializing Claude Code in background...
✅ Claude Code ready for instant responses!

2. Interactive Session:
💬 Chat started! Type your questions below.
   Commands: 'exit', 'quit', 'help'
   Tip: Claude Code is already running in background for instant responses!

🤖 You: what files are in the services directory?
🧠 NEXUS: I can see three main services in your project:

1. **gameserver/** - FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy
   - Core game logic and database operations
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - JWT authentication

2. **player-client/** - React frontend for players
   - Game interface and dashboard
   - Real-time WebSocket connections
   - Responsive design

3. **admin-ui/** - React admin interface
   - Universe visualization with D3.js
   - Player management tools
   - System monitoring

All services are containerized with Docker Compose.

Let me fix these for you:
