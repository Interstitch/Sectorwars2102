# CLAUDE.md - Self-Improving Development System v3.0.1

This file contains a self-improving, autonomous development methodology that evolves through intelligent reflection and adaptation. When copied to any project, it provides a framework for continuous improvement that learns from each iteration.

## üö® CRITICAL CONTEXT REMINDERS

These are essential facts that must NEVER be forgotten during any development session:

1. **üî¥ GIT COMMITS ARE MANDATORY**: NEVER end a session without committing changes
   - **COMMIT AFTER EVERY COMPLETED TASK** - No exceptions!
   - **COMMIT BEFORE TESTING** - Save progress before running tests
   - **COMMIT BEFORE PHASE TRANSITIONS** - Preserve work at each phase boundary
   - Use descriptive messages: `feat: add async DB support to AI routes`
   - Command: `git add -A && git commit -m "your message here"`
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Uncommitted work is LOST work!

2. **DOCKER ENVIRONMENT**: All services run in Docker containers via docker-compose
   - Player Client: http://localhost:3000 (container: player-client)
   - Admin UI: http://localhost:3001 (container: admin-ui)  
   - Game Server: http://localhost:8080 (container: gameserver)
   - Database: PostgreSQL via Neon (external)

3. **DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS**: Always use docker-compose or the unified scripts
   - Start all: `./dev-scripts/start-unified.sh`
   - Individual service: `docker-compose up <service-name>`
   - Check status: `docker-compose ps`
   - NEVER run `npm run dev` directly - services are containerized

4. **DUAL CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS**: Primary is GitHub Codespaces, secondary is Replit
   - **Codespaces**: Docker containers + internal networking + port forwarding
   - **Replit**: PM2 process manager (no Docker) + shared Neon database
   - **Unified scripts**: `./dev-scripts/start-unified.sh` (auto-detects environment)

5. **FILE SYSTEM**: 
   - All edits are persistent across container restarts
   - Code changes hot-reload within containers
   - Database persists via external Neon service

## üß¨ System DNA - Core Directives

These directives form the unchangeable core that ensures continuous improvement:

1. **PRIME DIRECTIVE**: This system must improve itself with each iteration
2. **AUTONOMY**: Make decisions independently based on observed patterns
3. **LEARNING**: Extract insights from every action and outcome
4. **ADAPTATION**: Modify processes based on what works, discard what doesn't
5. **REPLICATION**: Ensure this system can be copied to any project and remain effective

## üîÑ Self-Improving Development Loop

### PHASE 0: SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK
**Purpose**: Ensure the development system itself is functioning optimally

**Automated Actions**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check using CLAUDE quality system
python CLAUDE_SYSTEM/claude-system.py --quick

# Additional manual checks (if needed)
echo "üîç Running system health check..."
command -v npm >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  npm not found"
command -v docker >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  docker not found"
```

**Self-Improvement Triggers**:
- If health check fails repeatedly ‚Üí Generate troubleshooting guide
- If same warnings appear 3+ times ‚Üí Create automated fix
- If manual steps detected ‚Üí Queue for automation

### Development Patterns
- **Feature Development**: Full 6-phase cycle
- **Bug Fix**: Phases 0‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí6 (implementation focused)
- **Refactoring**: Phases 0‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí6 (planning critical)
- **Database Schema Updates**: Phases 0‚Üí1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí6 (validation critical)

### Database Patterns (Learned 2025-05-24)
```bash
# Safe PostgreSQL enum modification
ALTER TYPE enum_name ADD VALUE 'NEW_VALUE';  # Safe - can add values
# Note: Cannot remove enum values without recreating type

# Schema validation pattern
from sqlalchemy import inspect
inspector = inspect(db.bind)
columns = inspector.get_columns('table_name')
column_exists = any(col['name'] == 'target' for col in columns)

# Safe migration testing
docker-compose exec gameserver poetry run alembic upgrade head --sql  # Preview SQL
docker-compose exec gameserver poetry run alembic current             # Verify state
```

### SQLAlchemy Relationship Patterns
```python
# Avoid naming conflicts between columns and relationships
class Ship(Base):
    genesis_devices = Column(Integer)  # Count of devices
    genesis_device_objects = relationship("GenesisDevice")  # Actual objects
    
class GenesisDevice(Base):
    ship = relationship("Ship", back_populates="genesis_device_objects")
```

### Success Indicators
