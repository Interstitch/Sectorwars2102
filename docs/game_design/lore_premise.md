## The Collapse and the New Frontier

The year is 2102. A century has passed since the 'Great Collapse,' a period of intense resource wars and ecological devastation that shattered the old interstellar empires of humanity. Hyperspace lanes, once bustling with commerce and military fleets, became fragmented and dangerous. Planets were lost, knowledge was scattered, and humanity was thrown into a new dark age.

Now, pockets of civilization are re-emerging. Hardy pioneers, opportunistic traders, and ruthless warlords are venturing back into the forgotten sectors of space. The galaxy is a wild frontier, teeming with unknown dangers, lost technologies, and the promise of immense wealth or a quick death.

## The Spark of Resurgence

Players enter this universe as independent 'Sector Captains.' They might be driven by a desire to rebuild, to explore the unknown, to amass a fortune, or simply to survive. The old laws are gone, and new powers are beginning to coalesce. The future of the galaxy is unwritten, and every captain's actions will contribute to shaping it.

## Key Themes:

*   **Exploration & Discovery:** Unveiling lost sectors, charting new hyperspace routes, finding forgotten colonies, and encountering strange alien remnants (non-sentient or enigmatic).
*   **Resource Management & Trade:** Scavenging resources, mining asteroids, establishing trade routes in a volatile economy.
*   **Conflict & Survival:** Piracy is rampant, and nascent factions vie for control of valuable territories. Players must defend themselves and choose their battles wisely.
*   **Technological Scavenging & Advancement:** Rediscovering and adapting lost technologies to upgrade ships and equipment.
