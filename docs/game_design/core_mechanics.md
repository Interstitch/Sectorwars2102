## Game Objective (High Level)

To become a renowned Sector Captain by achieving success through exploration, trade, combat, and influence within the re-emerging galaxy of 2102.

## Core Gameplay Loop

The gameplay of Sector Wars 2102 revolves around a continuous cycle of activities:

1.  **Explore:**
    *   Navigate star systems and sectors via a 2D galaxy map interface.
    *   Discover new planets, asteroid fields, derelict ships, anomalies, and hidden hyperspace jump points.
    *   Scan celestial bodies for resources and points of interest.

2.  **Acquire & Manage Resources:**
    *   Mine asteroids for raw materials (e.g., common ores, rare crystals, exotic gases).
    *   Salvage derelict ships or outposts for components and cargo.
    *   Trade commodities at space stations or with other entities. Prices fluctuate based on supply, demand, and local events.
    *   Manage cargo hold space and ship fuel/energy.

3.  **Engage & Interact:**
    *   **Combat:** Real-time or turn-based (to be decided) tactical ship-to-ship combat. Manage ship systems (shields, weapons, engines). Encounter pirates, faction patrols, and environmental hazards.
    *   **Missions:** Accept and complete procedurally generated or story-driven missions (e.g., cargo delivery, bounty hunting, exploration contracts, rescue operations).
    *   **Diplomacy (Basic):** Interact with NPC factions. Reputation will affect trade prices, mission availability, and hostility levels.

4.  **Upgrade & Progress:**
    *   Use acquired resources and currency to buy new ships.
    *   Install new modules and equipment on ships (e.g., better weapons, stronger shields, faster engines, larger cargo holds, specialized scanners).
    *   Repair ship damage.
    *   Potentially, upgrade player skills or perks (e.g., better negotiation, improved piloting, advanced engineering).

5.  **Repeat:** Each action feeds into the others, creating a dynamic loop where players continually seek to improve their standing, wealth, and capabilities.
