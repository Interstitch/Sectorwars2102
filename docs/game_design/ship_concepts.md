# Sector Wars 2102 - Ship Concepts (Iteration 1)

**Document Owner:** Game Designer (Simulated)
**Date:** May 10, 2025

This document outlines initial concepts for player-usable ship classes in Sector Wars 2102. These are not final and are intended to establish roles and a starting point for design. Specific names, stats, and visual designs will be developed in later iterations.

## Ship Classification Philosophy

Ships will generally fall into broad categories based on their primary role and size. Players will start with a basic, versatile vessel and can acquire more specialized or powerful ships as they progress.

## Initial Ship Class Concepts:

1.  **Scout/Explorer Class (Codename: "Pathfinder")**
    *   **Role:** Long-range exploration, fast travel, information gathering.
    *   **Characteristics:** High speed, advanced sensor suites, good fuel efficiency, light armament, small cargo capacity.
    *   **Typical Use:** Charting new sectors, locating resource deposits, avoiding combat.

2.  **Freighter/Hauler Class (Codename: "Bulkhead")**
    *   **Role:** Transporting large quantities of cargo.
    *   **Characteristics:** Very large cargo capacity, slow speed, moderate defenses (shields/armor), minimal armament.
    *   **Typical Use:** Commodity trading, large-scale resource transport.

3.  **Corvette/Escort Class (Codename: "Guardian")**
    *   **Role:** Combat, escort duty, patrol.
    *   **Characteristics:** Balanced speed and maneuverability, moderate armament and defenses, small to medium cargo capacity.
    *   **Typical Use:** Protecting freighters, engaging pirates, undertaking combat-focused missions.

4.  **Frigate/Assault Class (Codename: "Interceptor")**
    *   **Role:** Heavy combat, offensive operations.
    *   **Characteristics:** Powerful weaponry, strong shields/armor, moderate speed, limited cargo capacity.
    *   **Typical Use:** Attacking hostile targets, leading assaults on outposts (if implemented).

5.  **Industrial/Mining Class (Codename: "Extractor")**
    *   **Role:** Specialized resource extraction.
    *   **Characteristics:** Equipped with advanced mining lasers/drones, moderate cargo capacity for raw materials, slow, may require escort.
    *   **Typical Use:** Efficiently harvesting resources from asteroid fields or gas clouds.

## Future Considerations:

*   Capital ships (Destroyers, Cruisers - potentially late-game or NPC only)
*   Specialized electronic warfare ships
*   Stealth/Covert Ops ships
*   Ship manufacturers or design philosophies influencing stats and module compatibility.
*   Visual differentiation between ships of the same class but different tiers/manufacturers.
