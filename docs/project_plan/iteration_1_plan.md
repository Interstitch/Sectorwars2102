# Sector Wars 2102 - Project Plan: Iteration 1

**Date:** May 10, 2025
**Iteration Lead:** Project Planner (Simulated)

## Goals for Iteration 1:

1.  **Establish Foundational Documentation:** Create initial versions of key documents including Game Design, Developer Requirements, DevOps setup, and AI Specs.
2.  **Define Core Game Concept:** Solidify the high-level premise, core game loop, and initial ideas for ships and factions for "Sector Wars 2102".
3.  **Outline Technical Stack:** Document the planned Docker-based PHP and PostgreSQL stack.
4.  **Prepare for Iteration 2:** Lay the groundwork for more detailed documentation and feature fleshing in the next iteration.

## Key Deliverables for Iteration 1:

*   **Game Design Document (Initial Drafts):**
    *   `lore_premise.md`: High-level story and universe concept.
    *   `core_mechanics.md`: Definition of the primary gameplay loop (e.g., explore, trade, fight, upgrade).
    *   `ship_concepts.md`: Initial list and brief description of player-usable ship classes (placeholder names acceptable, focus on roles).
    *   `faction_concepts.md`: Initial ideas for major NPC factions or enemy types.
*   **Developer Requirements (Initial Drafts):**
    *   `initial_requirements.md`: High-level technical features needed (e.g., user auth, galaxy map, ship movement).
    *   `database_schema_v1.md`: First pass at essential database tables and fields.
*   **DevOps Setup (Initial Drafts):**
    *   `docker_setup.md`: Description of the Docker environment.
    *   `Dockerfile` (for PHP application).
    *   `docker-compose.yml` (for orchestrating PHP, PostgreSQL, and potentially a web server).
*   **AI Specs (Initial Drafts):**
    *   Abridged summaries for each of the documents listed above, designed for AI parsing.
*   **Feature Docs:**
    *   Placeholder to establish the directory. Detailed feature docs will be developed in subsequent iterations.

## Team Responsibilities (Simulated):

*   **Project Planner:** Oversee Iteration 1, ensure all planned documents are initiated.
*   **Game Designer:** Lead creation of `core_mechanics.md`, `ship_concepts.md`, `faction_concepts.md`.
*   **Lore and Wording Writer:** Lead creation of `lore_premise.md`.
*   **Developer:** Lead creation of `initial_requirements.md`, `database_schema_v1.md`.
*   **DevOps:** Lead creation of `docker_setup.md`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`.

## Next Steps (Post Iteration 1):

1.  **Review & Refine:** The team will review all Iteration 1 documents for completeness (relative to Iteration 1 goals), clarity, and consistency.
2.  **Plan Iteration 2:** Based on the review, define specific, actionable goals for Iteration 2, focusing on expanding details in all areas.
