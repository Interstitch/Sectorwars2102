# AI Spec: Sector Wars 2102 - Faction Concepts (Iteration 1)

**Source Document:** `docs/game_design/faction_concepts.md`
**Date:** May 10, 2025

## Faction Design Philosophy:
- Dynamic backdrop: opportunities, threats, living galaxy.
- Varying goals, territories, tech levels, disposition.

## Initial Faction Concepts:
1.  **Terran Remnant Compact (TRC):** Descendants of old government. Seek order, law. Bureaucratic. High-ish tech (older reliable).
2.  **Orion Syndicate:** Criminal enterprise (smuggling, piracy). Ruthless, pragmatic. Mixed tech (retrofitted/stolen).
3.  **Jupiter Mining Guild (JMG):** Corporate. Resource extraction/production. Protective of assets. Specialized industrial/defensive tech.
4.  **The Free Drifters Coalition:** Loose alliance of independents. Value freedom, autonomy. Fringe dwellers. Diverse, adapted tech.
5.  **The Void Cultists (Placeholder):** Enigmatic, aggressive, fanatical. Unpredictable threat. Alien-influenced/unstable tech.

## Future Considerations:
- Minor factions, independent stations.
- Faction relationships (alliances, rivalries).
- Player impact on faction standing/territory.
- Unique faction ships, equipment, missions.
