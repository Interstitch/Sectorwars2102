# AI Spec: Sector Wars 2102 - Ship Concepts (Iteration 1)

**Source Document:** `docs/game_design/ship_concepts.md`
**Date:** May 10, 2025

## Ship Classification Philosophy:
- Broad categories by role and size.
- Progression from basic to specialized/powerful ships.

## Initial Ship Class Concepts (Codename - Role):
1.  **"Pathfinder" - Scout/Explorer:** High speed, advanced sensors, light arms, small cargo.
2.  **"Bulkhead" - Freighter/Hauler:** Very large cargo, slow, moderate defense, minimal arms.
3.  **"Guardian" - Corvette/Escort:** Balanced speed/maneuverability, moderate arms/defense, small-medium cargo.
4.  **"Interceptor" - Frigate/Assault:** Powerful weapons, strong shields/armor, moderate speed, limited cargo.
5.  **"Extractor" - Industrial/Mining:** Advanced mining gear, moderate raw material cargo, slow.

## Future Considerations:
- Capital ships (Destroyers, Cruisers).
- Specialized E-warfare, Stealth ships.
- Ship manufacturers/design philosophies.
