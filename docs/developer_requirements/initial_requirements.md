# Sector Wars 2102 - Initial Developer Requirements (Iteration 1)

**Document Owner:** Developer (Simulated)
**Date:** May 10, 2025

This document outlines the initial high-level technical requirements for Sector Wars 2102, based on the game concepts defined in Iteration 1. These will be expanded and refined in subsequent iterations.

## Core Technical Goals:

*   **Web-Based Application:** The game will be accessible via a web browser.
*   **Persistent Universe:** Player actions and game state should persist between sessions.
*   **Multiplayer (Future Goal - Design for it now):** While initial development might focus on single-player experience, the architecture should accommodate future multiplayer capabilities.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of players and an expanding game universe.
*   **Modularity:** Game systems should be developed as distinct modules to facilitate easier development, testing, and maintenance.

## Key Systems & Features (Initial Focus for Iteration 2 Development Planning):

1.  **User Authentication & Account Management:**
    *   Secure user registration (username, password, email).
    *   Login/logout functionality.
    *   Session management.

2.  **Basic Game State Representation:**
    *   Player character/captain profile (name, current ship, credits, location).
    *   Ship instances (linking a player to a specific ship type with basic stats like current health, cargo).
    *   Representation of the game universe (e.g., sectors, planets - initially very basic).

3.  **Galaxy Map & Navigation (Simplified):**
    *   Display a basic 2D map of a few interconnected star systems/sectors.
    *   Allow players to select a destination sector and initiate travel (initially, this could be a simple timer or abstract movement).

4.  **Resource Representation:**
    *   Define basic resource types (e.g., Fuel, Common Ore, Rare Crystal).
    *   Allow players to have an inventory of these resources associated with their ship.

5.  **Basic Actions (Proof of Concept):**
    *   **Movement:** Travel between adjacent sectors.
    *   **Mining (Abstract):** A simple action to gain a small amount of a predefined resource in a sector.
    *   **Trading (Abstract):** Buy/sell a resource at a fixed price at a designated trade point (e.g., a single station in a starting sector).

6.  **Database Backend:**
    *   PostgreSQL database to store all persistent game data (player accounts, ship states, universe data, etc.).

7.  **API Layer:**
    *   PHP-based API to handle game logic, data access, and communication between the client (browser) and the server.

## Technology Stack (Reiteration):

*   **Backend:** PHP (specific framework to be decided, e.g., Laravel, Symfony, or custom).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL.
*   **Containerization:** Docker (for development and deployment).
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (specific framework/libraries to be decided, e.g., Vue.js, React, or vanilla JS for initial simplicity).

## Non-Functional Requirements (Initial Thoughts):

*   **Security:** Basic protection against common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS).
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure player data is saved reliably.

## Next Steps (for Developer in Iteration 2):

*   Develop `database_schema_v1.md` with tables for users, ships, basic resources, and sectors.
*   Begin outlining API endpoints for the initial features.
*   Set up the basic Dockerized PHP/PostgreSQL development environment.
