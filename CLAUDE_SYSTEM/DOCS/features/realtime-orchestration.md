## 📊 Live Output Format

### Agent Selection Phase
```
🎭 [17:23:16] ORCHESTRATOR: 🧠 Analyzing request complexity and required expertise...
🎭 [17:23:17] ORCHESTRATOR: 🏗️ Atlas (Architect) selected for design and architecture
🎭 [17:23:17] ORCHESTRATOR: 🔍 Sherlock (Detective) selected for analysis and investigation
🎭 [17:23:17] ORCHESTRATOR: ⚡ Velocity (Optimizer) selected for performance improvements
```

### Parallel Execution Phase
```
🤖 [17:23:17] Architect STARTING: Beginning analysis of: 'Analyze the FastAPI architecture...'
🤖 [17:23:17] Debugger STARTING: Beginning analysis of: 'Analyze the FastAPI architecture...'
🤖 [17:23:17] Optimizer STARTING: Beginning analysis of: 'Analyze the FastAPI architecture...'
```

### Progress Tracking
```
📊 [17:23:19] Progress: 33.3% - Agent architect completed successfully
📊 [17:23:19] Progress: 66.7% - Agent debugger completed successfully  
📊 [17:23:19] Progress: 100.0% - Agent optimizer completed successfully
```

### Inter-Agent Conversations
```
💭 [17:23:19] Architect → Debugger: I've designed the system architecture. Can you analyze the complexity?
💭 [17:23:20] Debugger → Optimizer: Analysis complete. The design looks solid, but I recommend performance review.
💭 [17:23:20] Optimizer → Tester: I see optimization opportunities. We'll need comprehensive testing for these changes.
```

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Multi-Claude Communication
```python
# Scratchpad-based messaging
scratchpad_message = ScratchpadMessage(
    agent_id="architect",
    target_agent="debugger", 
    content="System design complete",
    metadata={"design_complexity": "medium"}
)
```

### Parallel Execution Engine
```python
# True concurrency with ThreadPoolExecutor
futures = []
for agent in selected_agents:
    future = self.executor.submit(self._execute_agent_async, agent, user_request)
    futures.append(future)
```

### Real-Time Output Handler
```python
# Live streaming with timestamps
def emit_message(self, message_type: MessageType, agent_id: str, content: str):
    message = RealTimeMessage(
        timestamp=datetime.now().isoformat(),
        message_type=message_type,
        agent_id=agent_id,
        content=content
    )
    self.output_handler.emit(message)
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Request Formulation
1. **Be Specific**: "Analyze FastAPI performance" vs "Look at the code"
2. **Include Context**: "Review authentication system for security issues"
3. **Set Scope**: "Optimize database queries in user service"

### Agent Selection Optimization
- Use **multiple keywords** to get the right agent combination
- **Architecture + Performance** → Architect + Optimizer
- **Security + Testing** → Security + Tester
- **Analysis + Documentation** → Debugger + Documenter

### Interpreting Output
1. **Watch Agent Selection** - Understand why specific agents were chosen
2. **Monitor Progress** - See which agents complete first
3. **Read Conversations** - Agents build on each other's insights
4. **Review Final Summary** - Collaborative analysis combines all perspectives

## 🔧 Configuration

### Timeout Settings
```python
# Execution timeout (default: 5 minutes)
EXECUTION_TIMEOUT = 300  # seconds
```

### Agent Limits
```python
# Maximum agents per request (default: 3-5)
MAX_AGENTS_PER_REQUEST = 5
```

### Output Verbosity
```python
# Control output detail level
VERBOSITY_LEVEL = "detailed"  # minimal, standard, detailed
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Typical Performance
- **Agent Selection**: 1-2 seconds
- **Parallel Execution**: 3-8 seconds (depending on complexity)
- **Total Request Time**: 5-15 seconds
- **Concurrent Agents**: Up to 8 simultaneously

### Scalability
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB per active agent
- **CPU Usage**: Scales with number of active agents
- **Network**: Minimal (local Claude Code calls)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Slow Agent Selection
```
🎭 [17:23:16] ORCHESTRATOR: 🧠 Analyzing request complexity... (taking too long)
```
**Solution**: Request may be too vague. Be more specific with keywords.

#### Agent Execution Timeout
```
❌ Agent execution timeout after 300 seconds
```
**Solution**: Request may be too complex. Break into smaller, focused requests.

#### No Agents Selected
```
🎯 Selected core agents for general request
```
**Solution**: Your request didn't match any specific keywords. Use more specific language.

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug output
export NEXUS_DEBUG=1
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "your request"
```

## 🔗 Integration

### With Quality System
Real-time orchestration integrates with the CLAUDE quality system:
```bash
# Combine quality analysis with AI insights
python claude-system.py --analyze
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Analyze the quality report findings"
```

### With Development Workflow
```bash
# Pre-commit analysis
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Review my changes before commit"

# Post-deployment validation  
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Validate deployment and identify issues"
```

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Combinations
Force specific agent combinations by using targeted keywords:

```bash
# Architecture + Security focus
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Design secure system architecture with protection mechanisms"

# Testing + Documentation focus  
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Create comprehensive test documentation and validation guide"
```

### Multi-Stage Workflows
Chain multiple real-time requests for complex analysis:

```bash
# Stage 1: Analysis
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Analyze current system architecture"

# Stage 2: Optimization  
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Optimize the analyzed architecture for performance"

# Stage 3: Validation
python claude-system.py --ai-realtime "Create tests to validate the optimized architecture"
```
