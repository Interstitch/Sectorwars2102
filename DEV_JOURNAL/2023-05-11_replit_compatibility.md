# Topic: Replit Compatibility Enhancement

## Context
While the Docker-based approach works well for local development and GitHub Codespaces, we discovered that standard Replit environments do not support Docker. Since Replit is a critical development platform for iPad compatibility, we needed to adapt our setup to work without Docker while maintaining our microservices architecture.

## Decisions
1. Create a fallback mechanism for Replit that starts services directly
2. Maintain the Docker-based approach for environments where Docker is available
3. Keep a single codebase that works across all environments
4. Update the Replit configuration to include necessary dependencies

## Implementation
- Created a new `start-replit.sh` script that runs services directly without Docker
- Modified `start.sh` to detect when Docker isn't available and use the fallback
- Updated `.replit` configuration with Nix packages and proper language settings
- Ensured consistent environment variables across all environments
- Set up proper port forwarding for all three services

## Challenges
1. Maintaining service isolation without containerization
2. Ensuring consistent port assignments across environments
3. Managing dependencies for multiple services (Python + Node.js)
4. Handling process management for multiple simultaneous services

## Solutions
1. Used background processes with proper tracking for non-Docker mode
2. Configured environment variables consistently across environments
3. Added Nix configuration to .replit for dependency management
4. Implemented proper process cleanup in the fallback script

## Lessons
- Multi-environment development requires graceful degradation strategies
- Platform-specific configuration is sometimes necessary despite best efforts
- Process management is more complex without containerization
- A unified startup script with environment detection simplifies development

## Next Steps
1. Test the fallback mechanism in an actual Replit environment
2. Document potential differences between Docker and non-Docker modes
3. Explore if a Docker-capable Replit template might be a better long-term solution
4. Implement database connection pooling to avoid connection issues
5. Consider adding health checks to verify all services are running properly
