# Development Journal

This directory contains development journal entries documenting the evolution of the Sector Wars 2102 project. Each entry captures key decisions, challenges, solutions, and learnings throughout the development process.

## Purpose

- Track the thought process behind architectural and design decisions
- Document challenges encountered and their solutions
- Create a knowledge base for future reference
- Provide context for code changes over time

## Journal Structure

Entries are organized chronologically with the following naming convention:

`YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`

For example:
- `2023-05-10_project_initialization.md`
- `2023-05-15_database_design.md`

## Entry Format

Each journal entry follows this format:

```markdown
# Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Challenges

## Usage Guidelines

- Create a new entry for significant development activities
- Focus on explaining "why" rather than just "what" or "how"
- Include code snippets or links to relevant files when helpful
- Update entries if new information becomes available
