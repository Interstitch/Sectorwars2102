# Topic: Project Restructuring

## Context
The Sector Wars 2102 project was initially created as a monolithic Flask application. After evaluating the codebase and development workflow across multiple environments (local MacBook, GitHub Codespaces, and Replit), it was determined that a complete restructuring would better serve the project's future needs.

## Decisions
1. Adopt a microservices architecture with three main components:
   - Game API Server: Core game logic and database operations
   - Player Client: Web interface for players
   - Admin UI: Interface for game administration
   
2. Transition from Flask to FastAPI for the backend:
   - Better performance characteristics
   - Native support for async/await
   - Automatic API documentation
   - Built-in request/response validation with Pydantic
   
3. Implement a containerized approach using Docker:
   - Ensure consistency across development environments
   - Simplify setup and onboarding
   - Enable custom configuration for Replit compatibility
   
4. Switch to a remote Neon PostgreSQL database:
   - Persistent storage accessible from all environments
   - Eliminates need for database setup in each environment
   - Professional-grade PostgreSQL features

5. Implement comprehensive testing strategy:
   - Pytest for unit and integration testing
   - Cypress for end-to-end testing
   - CI/CD pipeline integration

## Implementation
- Created initial Docker configurations for each service
- Established directory structure for the new architecture
- Developed environment detection for multi-environment support
- Drafted comprehensive AI Specification documents
- Set up development journal to track project evolution

## Challenges
1. Maintaining Replit compatibility while using Docker
2. Ensuring seamless database access across environments
3. Balancing separation of concerns with development simplicity
4. Designing a testing approach suitable for AI agent automation

## Solutions
1. Created specialized Docker configuration for Replit environment
2. Implemented environment variable management for database connections
3. Designed clear API boundaries between services
4. Selected testing frameworks with programmatic interfaces for AI agent use

## Lessons
- A clean architectural break is sometimes more efficient than incremental refactoring
- Documenting architecture decisions early provides clarity for implementation
- AI-centered documentation (AISPEC) helps maintain consistent understanding
- Environment compatibility requires early consideration in architecture planning

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic scaffolding for each service
2. Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions
3. Create initial database migrations
4. Develop authentication system
5. Implement core game mechanics API endpoints
