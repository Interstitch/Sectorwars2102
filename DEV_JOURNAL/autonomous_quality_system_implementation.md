- Self-healing capabilities for Docker services, dependencies, and database issues
- Generates detailed JSON reports with improvement opportunities

#### 2. Test Explorer Integration (`tests/test_quality_system.py`)
**IDE-Friendly Testing:**
- Individual test functions for each analysis type
- Compatible with VS Code Test Explorer
- Pytest integration for easy execution
- Organized test categories (security, performance, quality, healing)

**Available Tests:**
- `test_full_quality_analysis()` - Complete system analysis
- `test_security_analysis()` - Security-focused checks
- `test_performance_analysis()` - Performance optimization analysis
- `test_code_quality_analysis()` - Code quality assessment
- `test_self_healing_system()` - Automatic healing verification
- `test_pattern_learning_system()` - Pattern learning validation
- `test_quick_health_check()` - Fast health verification

#### 3. Enhanced Quality Check Script (`dev-scripts/quality-check.py`)
**Unified Quality Gateway:**
- Replaces the previous bash script with Python-based solution
- Integrates all quality checks into single execution
- Backward compatible with existing workflow
- Enhanced reporting and analysis

### Integration with IDE Test Explorer

#### Running from Test Explorer
1. **Full Analysis**: Run `test_full_quality_analysis` for complete system review
2. **Security Check**: Run `test_security_analysis` for security audit
3. **Quick Health**: Run `test_quick_health_check` for rapid status
4. **Performance Review**: Run `test_performance_analysis` for optimization insights

#### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Full autonomous analysis
python dev-scripts/quality-check.py

# Pytest integration
python -m pytest tests/test_quality_system.py -v

# Specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_quality_system.py::TestQualitySystem::test_security_analysis -v
```
