# Topic: Workspace Cleanup and Reorganization

## Context
After setting up the initial microservices architecture, we needed to clean up the workspace to match the documented structure. The repository had a mix of old monolithic files and the new microservices structure, which could cause confusion and potential conflicts.

## Decisions
1. Remove all old monolithic files from the root directory
2. Organize the workspace to match the documented directory structure in AISPEC
3. Ensure Docker configuration works across all three target environments:
   - Local Development (Cursor IDE + Docker Desktop)
   - GitHub Codespaces (VS Code)
   - Replit (iPad compatible)

## Implementation
- Moved old Python files (main.py, models.py, sectors.py) to a backup location
- Removed unused configuration files (poetry.lock, pyproject.toml at root level)
- Cleared out old directories (static, templates, cypress, test, tests)
- Ensured DOCS directory structure matches specifications
- Verified all services (gameserver, player-client, admin-ui) have the correct structure
- Confirmed Docker configuration works across environments

## Challenges
1. Balancing backward compatibility with the new architecture
2. Ensuring Docker containers can communicate properly in each environment
3. Managing different environment configurations while maintaining a single codebase
4. Ensuring the correct structure for documentation and code

## Solutions
1. Created backup locations for old files instead of deleting them outright
2. Used environment detection in start.sh script to auto-configure for each environment
3. Used docker-compose.replit.yml as an override file for Replit-specific configurations
4. Structured the workspace to match the AISPEC documentation

## Lessons
- Keeping documentation and implementation in sync is crucial for maintainability
- Docker-based microservices provide excellent isolation but require careful configuration
- Environment-specific overrides help maintain a single codebase that works across platforms
- Documentation-driven development helps ensure architectural consistency

## Next Steps
1. Implement a proper database schema and migrations
2. Add authentication system using JWT
3. Develop core game mechanics API endpoints
4. Build out the Player Client interface
5. Develop the Admin UI universe visualization
6. Implement end-to-end tests for the complete system
